One of every one's favorite features in Clay is the ability to waterfall multiple data providers to find one email.

In the past I've done tests with Findymail, Datagma, Apollo.io, Nymblr - Verified B2B Leads & Custom Audiences for Salespeople & Marketers, People Data Labs, Clearout, Icypeas and Hunter.io. We tested 1,694 contacts from random industries with company sizes ranging from self employed to 10k employees. Of course, you should do your own testing for your Ideal Customer Profile segment to make a decision for you. 

The results are in the picture below. What I thought was interesting is some of the huge drop off rates after validation. (Debounce was the validation provider we used for the whole test.)

Findymail and Datagma both have solutions to try to validate catch all domains which is not accounted for here. (I send to both when they say it's valid and we stay under a 2% bounce rate.) 

Clearout also comes with a confidence score that works pretty reliably with their data (email people with over 90% confidence). 

Hunter.io had the best percent valid from found rate but found the least amount of emails. 

I also ran ANOTHER test to find work emails from a list of 2,103 people that had responded to an email campaign. So we know that the inbox is truly real. 

Findymail and Datagma basically tied for first place (they were within 10 emails of each other). 

My biggest takeaway from the test that it's not about picking one data provider or the other.

To this day, only one company has ever stumped me for a data request and that was Daria Danilina asking for companies that sell on Google meet which I'm not even sure how you would manually research that! 

Here's some common research categories and how I would automate scraping the data or using AI. 

1. Open Jobs - Jordan Crawford has this data. PredictLeads has this data and Clay just added an integration. This is a very solved problem. 

2. Headcount Growth by Department - Clay has an integration to find people that joined the company by time frame. Harmonic also has this data. 

3. Sub Industry - This one is interesting. No database usually has sales engagement tools as an industry. The way I would tackle this is by making a list of the sub industries that you want to know about and define them to GPT-4. Add a company description to a prompt and ask it if it fits any of the categories. Make sure it only outputs a category if it's 95% sure and it's ok to not include any category if it can't filter it. 

4. What does the company do? Use a GPT-4 prompt with the input being the company description. 

5. Who does the company sell to? Use a GPT-4 prompt with the input being the scraped text from a company website. 

6. Average pricing - Scrape the first result of a google search that is set up like 

site:example(dot)com pricing ""$"" 

This will return the pricing page as the first result. Scrape the contents of the first page and run it through GPT-4 for the average pricing. 

7. Competitors - Scrape the google preview text of the first 5 links when searching 

example(dot)com {{HQ Country}} competitors

Run the preview snippets through AI and prompt it to only mention competitors that are mentioned multiple times. 

8. Leadership changes in the last 12 months. Use Clay to look at the company LinkedIn page and find anyone in the C-Suite that has joined in the last 12 months. 

9. Technologies the company uses. BuiltWith has great data if the company installs the tech on their site. If you are searching for something like Quickbooks, use PredictLeads to find the technology mentioned in their job descriptions.

I'll be going over workflows like this and more with Reply.io at their Cold Email deep dive this Thursday! Comment if you want to join me. 

The goal of this email is to send something like 

""{{First Name}} -- I saw the company TikTok account posting about Steve Madden's latest fashion trends and celebrities representing the brand. 

Have you considered using UGC creators to create content for you. I had some ideas like {{AI Generated Ideas}}. 

Here's what we need for the workflow to work. 

1. Social media accounts of the brand/company
2. Captions from their past posts.
3. AI Magic

For step 1, we will use ""Scrape Website"" which is an integration inside of Clay. It gets us the social media account of the company and their SEO description which we will use later. 

For step 2, we will actually get this with a Google search. Google has built the best scraper in the world, use it. We will create a search that looks like this site:https://lnkd.in/eZ6vUz33 June 2023. 

Step 3 will use GPT-4 to tie this all together. 

First, we will use the previews of the captions to summarize what the brand's post about. Here's my prompt:

Using the input, summarize what a tiktok account usually posts about and complete my sentence. This is the input: ""Google previews"" Keep the output under 8 words and use keywords from the input. Make sure to summarize the text with what this tiktok account usually posts about. Complete each output with my prefix. This is my prefix: ""I saw your TikTok account and noticed you post about""

Next we will write a prompt to generate the creative ideas based on what they have posted in the past and their SEO description. This is what I used. 

Using the inputs, create 3 video ideas that User generated content creators would be able to build on behalf of the brand. The inputs I'm going to give you include the description of the company and captions of some of their recent posts. This is the description of the company: ""SEO description"" This is some captions of their recent posts: ""Google Previews"" Keep the output to just 3 sentences and output creative ideas for the brand to imagine what creators can post on their behalf.


The output for Bodybuilding(dot)com looks like this -- ""Content creators could share their personal fitness journey by demonstrating how the exercise programs, supplements and diets offered by the brand have positively impacted their health. There might also be a series of fun and engaging 'Beat the summer heat' workout challenges using bodybuilding.com products. Lastly, content creators can post humorous fitness instructional videos featuring bodybuilding.com workouts, playing off the ""Looking for a funny personal trainer!"" post.

urn:li:activity:7084184336538718208,"Showing a prospect in an email how you can help them is way better than telling them. Here is one way we are doing it. 

The goal of the email is to show them that we know who their potential customers are and help them find them. 

This is the email I want to fulfill on. 
___________________
{{first_name}} I was taking a look at your website and figured your sell to people like Founders, VPs of Sales, and Directors of Sales Development. It looks like you help them keep their Salesforce updated with real time call notes. 

If you are trying to reach out to these prospects with cold emails like this, are you doing this automatically or still using Sales Nav manually?

We help people build their lead lists automatically and I figured that this LinkedIn profile (linkedin(dot)com/in/example) would be a good prospect for you. Here's their email and direct company phone.

This whole email was generated with AI and automation, if one lead isn't enough, could I show you how we do it?
____________________

My goal here is to show people how we can automatically pull in so much information about their company AND give them a lead that would be a good fit. 

In order to achieve this we need: 
1: A generation of who they sell to
2. A generation of what they help people do
3. A lead that would be good for them. 

If you have been following me for a bit, 1 and 2 is super easy to do by scraping the content of their website and using a GPT Prompt. 
Something like - ""Using the input, tell me the job titles or types of people this company sells to. This is the input: ""company description"". Only return a list of titles or people. An example of an output that is formatted correctly is this ""CEO, VP of Sales, and Director of Sales"". Only output job titles, do not output anything other than the job titles.""

The challenge here lies in getting a lead for the company. Buckle up

1: We have to determine the company's ideal customer profile and companies that fit that. We can use AI to get this done.
2. We take that report and we can do 1 of 3 things. We can either Ask AI to give us a company that fits this criteria (my preference). We can Google for a company. Or we can use Jordan Crawford's job data. In this flow I asked AI. 
3. Now we have 2 things we really need. The title of the person that we are reaching out to and a name of a company that would be a good fit for their product or service. We can create a google search to find the LinkedIn profile of a person. 

So an example Google Search could be ""linkedin.com/in/ GTM Manager Brex"" and our friend Stockton Huskinson would be the LinkedIn profile we'd be sending in the email. 

We can use data and AI to show potential prospects that we know them and it doesn't have to be manually researched every time. 

This can all be done with some elbow grease and Clay.

This automates a methodology called ""Why You, Why Now"" I learned from John Barrows. 

I will go over the triggers and you can see the process in the video below!

Trigger 1

New Customer support Team lead and past company support tech

Example of first line: ""Hey Suchita, noticed you recently were promoted to Principal Customer Success Manager in March. Before working at 6sense, I saw you worked at Yext. Noticed both companies are using Zendesk and Drift right now. How's your experience with them?""

Trigger 2 

Customer support team growth by percentage and looking for those that are in a qualifying range.

Example of first line: I noticed that 6sense added 20 customer support people in the last 3 months. Are your current processes still working with the team growth?

Trigger 3

New Product Launch and leverage AI to discuss what support questions might come up with it.

Example of first line: I figured customers might reach out for support around things like utilizing the new AI Writer tool in their sales process.

Trigger 4 

No Support tech on site. We can even compare this to how many employees the company has and how long they have been in business. 

Example of first line (not for 6sense): Noticed you aren't using any support tech on the site. I'd imagine that since the business was founded in 2014 and you just broke 100 employees that your old processes might not be working any more. 

Trigger 5 

Using competitive support tech on site and have different things to say depending on which competitor they are using. 

Example of first line: Noticed you're using Zoho Support, have you found their multichannel inbox to be useful in support or are things falling through the cracks?

Trigger 6

Hiring for Customer Support and use AI to deduct tasks that are mentioned in the job description that your tool could optimize or replace!

Example of first line: Noticed you're hiring for as Customer Support Associate. Took a look at the job description and it looked like they will need to respond to emails with appropriate answers to customers. Are you thinking about how AI can be leveraged to speed up this process?

Trigger 7 

They have a generic support email and either no support tech on site OR they have support tech on site (which lets us know that they need to have everything in one place).

Example of first line: Noticed on the site you weren't using a support software but I found support@domain.com is up there. Are you finding that you can answer all of your support questions without dropping things with just an inbox?

In a follow up email, we could say something like below to keep the personalization going. 

""I figured customers might reach out for support around things like leveraging 6sense's AI for creating and converting high-quality pipelines.""

subject: Outbound edge

{{First Name}}  I was on your site and it looks like you sell to {{job titles}} titles. It looked like you are helping {{AI Generation}}.

I had to assume you are using outbound tactics considering {{Full Name of SDR}} is an {{SDR/BDR}} on the team. 

Are you thinking about how they could be leveraging better data and GPT-4 to do their prospecting?

The reason I ask is because we are helping companies like Rippling and Ramp with our tool that collects the data and writes the messaging for them. 

Would this be worth a chat to build a custom outbound table for you?

{{First Name}}  as youre helping people {{Ai generation}}, Id imagine you are using outbound marketing tactics like the following. 

{{Creative Ideas}} 

Have you cracked how to do this persona targeting and data enrichment automatically or is your team still using tools like Sales Nav to do manual research?

If so, would it be worth taking some time to show you how we can automate persona and account research for your outbound team?


Email 3 

Subject: show and tell

{{First Name}}  I sent an email a while back with the subject Outbound edge that probably didnt do a good enough job showing you how we could help your outbound team. 

Our tool combines over 40 databases into one spreadsheet so that your team can see all of the data in front of them instead of manually researching accounts. 

For example at your company

It looks like your sales team has seen a {{percent change}}% change in the past 3 months. 
Your LinkedIn Company account has gained {{number of Followers}} in the past 3 months. 
The company looks like it has {{Number of sales people}} people with Sales in their title based in the United States today. 

Besides cute things like this, we also monitor for recent news, open job positions, tech on site and mentioned in job descriptions and a lot more. 

On a call, we can build a custom workflow for your team to automate their outbound research. Wanna make it happen?

{{First Name}}  Perhaps this is not your area of focus. Should I potentially reach out to {{Other sales/marketing person in the company thats NOT them}} given their role as a {{Job title cleaned with AI}}.
____
Overall, everything was done with data gathered from LinkedIn and AI. No other crazy databases were needed to make this happen. 

This campaign also disqualifies far more people than it puts in. For instance, if we don't detect a BDR/SDR, the workflow ends and we don't reach out to the person. I only wanted this campaign to go out to people that would qualify for every data point. If they don't, I'd find something else to reach out to them with.

If you don't sell into these industries you might not know that getting the email of an owner or founder of a bowling alley or dance studio is very difficult. 

2 reasons for this

1) They often use a contact@bowlingalley.com email address or a free email address for their communication. 

2) Even if you have their email address, often they don't have a LinkedIn profile that you can confirm their identity and seniority with. 

This means that when you are sending emails, you look way more like a spam email than you when sending your other spam emails with just a {{First Name}} variable. (See my other posts to get past just one custom variable)

This is what we have done and gotten much better results. 

First, we start with analyzing their reviews and looking for SEO metadata. Something that can tell us more about what the company does and what people are saying about them. 

Then we create customization based on region to further niche down. 

Finally, I like to pull out more data for a P.S. line to keep the personalization going. 

You could end up with an email like this 

Hey there, 

I was taking a look at {{Company Name}}'s reviews on Yelp and saw Monica loves the attention she gets when she visits Dr. Dave for her chiropractor visits. How does Dr. Dave fill last minute cancellations? 

The reason I ask is because we are helping {{case study name in the area}} fill in last minute cancellations with a waitlist of patients. (And with over 455 google reviews, I'm sure you have a great waitlist). 

Let me know if you want to see an under 3 minute video of how it works!

P.S. noticed you're based on Main street, do you get a lot of walk in traffic from people passing by? Couldn't tell from Google Maps.

1. Define what you want the AI to accomplish generally. 
2. Give it all inputs that are necessary for it to make decisions. DO NOT ask it to tell you what a company does based on a website and no other information. It has no clue. 
3. Constrain the creativity of the AI. Give it guard rails like respond in only lower case letters, keep the output under 8 words, use keywords from the input, etc.

Cold email in 2023 has become a task for at minimum a no code expert as and better yet, a low code engineer.

The sales team reported to us that they had a higher intent than their other paid marketing forms. We sent roughly 2000 emails per day in the campaign.

Here were the top 3 things we did. 

1. Multi inbox, multi domain rotation. If you haven't seen this yet, you need to start researching it. Stop sending from your main domain, start sending from satellite domains. 

2. We knew that the industry would have a higher spam complaint rate. So instead of our usual sending 50 emails per day per inbox, we only sent 25. Allowing us to spread the reputation across even more inboxes and be friendlier to the ESPs. 

3. We used Google Maps location data provided to us by scraping with Clay so that we could personalize the message with a current customer success story in their area AND we personalized the P.S. line to their street address and the Google Traffic data (targeting realtors here).

Obviously, a solid offer and unique selling proposition are important but there are numerous levers for us to pull on if you already have that nailed down.

urn:li:activity:7047553136487473152,"I see too many people using AI and Chat GPT incorrectly. They are trying to get it to right their whole email and sometimes I see them trying to write completely ""custom"" emails.

Here's the problem

1. Chat GPT given too many tasks to do at once, begins to get off track and hallucinate. ex. are you sure it didn't say ""I hope this email finds you well"" in any of the emails. 

2. When you think about it, you don't actually need it to do all the copy for you. 

You can use it as a tool to help generate the final version but the snippets that actually need to be made for each prospect can be made with higher value and precision when you just focus on that.

3. I know you think it's helping your email delivery, but as of March 30, 2023, I don't think it makes that much of a difference. 

We send 250k emails per month and the highest open rate campaigns do the best job of matching targeted prospects with killer offers. 

The way I like to use Chat GPT is to make inferences on data and then use that data to write AT MOST 8 words. 

Not the whole email, not a whole sequence just 8 highly impactful words for my prospects that will make them understand how our product or service can help them. 

So now the question isn't, ""How can I use AI to write my emails"" it's ""How can I use AI to analyze data and make inferences for my prospect based on the data""

urn:li:activity:7046860822408507393,"Last week I launched an automated outbound campaign showing prospects how they could use Clay with 100% personalized tips.

With that in mind, I opened up GPT-4 and got to work. 

The first thing I did is figure out what I want to say. This campaign was for Clay so I knew I wanted to tell people about how they could build incredibly custom lists using the tool. 

I first needed to train the model so I added the company description of 4 companies. I taught Chat GPT that with the inputs of the company description, here are the ideas I would come up with. 

Here's an example of my prompt for Red Bull

__________________________________________________________________________

Using the input, create three bullet points of creative outbound marketing ideas for a company. The ideas have to be possible with cold email marketing. This is the input: ""Red Bull | 786,465 followers on LinkedIn. Red Bull Gives Wings to People and Ideas. | Red Bull Gives Wings to People and Ideas.  This drives us - and all we do - since 1987.  Today, Red Bull operates in over 170 countries selling more than 7.9 billion cans annually and growing!"" Analyze who their target audience would be by job title and think of creative ways to market to them. Be specific and give unique advice. Keep each bullet under 15 words and use strategies that use outbound marketing. 
__________________________________________________________

The outputs I showed Chat GPT would be answers that I wanted are here. 

- Target event planners: Offer co-branded Red Bull event kits to boost energy during conferences and corporate events.
- Approach sports coaches: Connect to provide Red Bull for team performance enhancement and sponsorship opportunities.
- Target Restaurant Owners: Teach them how to use Red Bull in mixed drinks and what special promotions they could run. 

I repeated that process 4 more times so I knew Chat GPT would understand what I was doing. 

From there, I just inserted the Company description of prospects and automated these lines. Basically saying, not exact copy

""Hey I had a look at your website and I'd bet you're running these outbound campaigns right now""

urn:li:activity:7041754010055270400,"I've been on a quest to find follow up emails that actually work. Seeing a 32% increase in Email 3 positive response with this method. 

For anyone that is doing outbound prospecting, we know that follow ups are important but they are not where your money will be made. On most sequences I see, the first emails is responsible for almost all of the positive responses. 

I wanted to put together a sequence that would challenge this. 

So I build a sequence where saved our best data for email 3. My hypothesis here is that someone sees email 1 with an offering and gets email 2 with more detail. 

If they respond to neither, really what are the odds of them being interested now? 

So we broke the thread and sent a completely new email thread for email 3. Used AI to automate the creation of the first line based on LinkedIn company data and PredictLeads data (all done in Clay). 

We taught ChatGPT to analyze open job roles and connect that to the companies mission (probably another post on this soon).

And then instead of using all of our data in Email 1, we just kept it to the open job role we found with Predict Leads and sent a John Barrows ""WYWN"" type email.

When Email 3 came around, we still sent ""WYWN"" style, but added the AI personalization. We took an email that had only slightly performed and boosted positive response rates by 32%. 

Why I think this works. 

1. People do need to be followed up with but when they see no good data about their company in anything other than email 1, they roll their eyes.
2. Sending all of your emails in one thread is a little over done in my opinion and we have stopped doing it all together.
3. The lines that we were creating with ChatGPT inside of Clay were borderline unbelievably good. Can't wait to see how GPT - 4 can enable this.

We wanted to add a more personal touch to the campaign as there's not a whole lot that can be done on the targeting side that could be changed. 

We used Clay to find the year that the target prospect graduated college and related a financial event that happened around the time that they graduated college. 

We used this event to be able to point out that even back then there was still opportunity for investments and now is not so different. 

The hardest part was just writing the lines for each financial crisis. We used ChatGPT to assist with this creation and called out some recent financial events (maybe we have to add SVB to the list).

This is especially true with cold email. (There was a time {{first name}} was state of the art)

So how can a small startup innovate today in order to catch up? 

My opinion is to start thinking about email as a highly targeted Ad network and NOT as a spray and pray approach. 

Instead of data searches with inputs like

Searches with inputs like this become more and more necessary.

A company I was working with was using copywriting that had been their tried and true script in cold email. 

It had a lot of good things going for it. Short copy, value based, soft CTA.

Immediately, I thought it was missing some spice, so I rewrote it to show the prospects how much pain they were in. 

The solution is a social media organization/posting tool in an industry where the prospects need to have a good social presence on 8 platforms at the same time. 

So I took to Clay to get some automations going. 

In this industry, the prospects potential customer will Google their name and their company name immediately to do research. If they don't show up in the top 8 social platforms, it hurts their conversion rate. 

I automated a Google search to see if they top 5 links include those Social platforms when I did the search. 

We then used OpenAI to summarize that data and write a different line based on how many social links came up in the top 5 and if there were any other people that were even intruding on their search. 

We mapped this data as a custom variable into the campaign and overnight so a 3x increase in conversion rates. 

The lesson. How can you show your prospects that they have a problem rather than just telling them about it. Here we just happened to use AI to make it happen. 

Tag someone that needs to use a little more AI in their life.

As long as they can clearly understand your value proposition and you are talking to people that you know have the problem (through manual research or with automation like Clay) what you say begins to matter less because you are talking to people that need a solution.

10 years ago, ads on smartphones were ridiculous and not customized at all. Now I see ads on instagram for skiing equipment I'm actually somewhat interested in. 

Why? because they have the data to back up why they are serving me the ad.

Cold email will have to be come this both out of technical and brand necessity, cold email must change. 

Technically, messaging will need to be innovated to get around spam filters. Every month there's more updates that crack down on cold email and what you can send. 

The same generic message being sent with just a {{First Name}} variable is an obvious flag for unsolicited messages. 

From a brand perspective, companies that spray and pray their market will built negative reputation and trust with their prospects. 

This is where the need for targeting like an ad network will be needed. 

Delivering messages to those that could actually use your product is paramount today but 100% necessary for survival in the future. 

Emailing people based on 

-job openings
-keywords on site
-new product launch
-shared customers
-shared investors
-target customers
-web traffic
-website technology
-intent
- and so many others 

will be the only way to deliver messages and get responses in the future.

How to do this?

Change your framework.

Let me explain

I sent 9,137 emails to about 2,500 contacts. So a four email sequence across about 45 days. The email sequence was an inquiry if they would be willing to sell their business. 

Most responses came to the first email hands down. That was also where we got most of our positive responses as well. As the sequence goes on, response rates plummet and the proportion of positive responses to overall responses goes with it. 

This was an experiment to help flesh out a hunch I've had that follow ups were far less important than speaking with net new contacts. So if you are in a market with 10s of thousands of contacts, maybe rethink your sequencing and follow up strategy. 

*Disclaimer: I of course know that positive responses come deeper in the funnel and this isn't a perfect test. I am confident though that my point still stands that if you have a wide market, talking to net new people more often is best.

1. Know if a company is B2B or B2C. 

Use Clay to scan their site for keywords like ""Free trial"", ""Enterprise"", ""get a demo"" on the company's website.

2. Find open jobs by keyword at a company. 

You can use PredictLeads and their integration with Clay to find open jobs at your target accounts completely automatically.

3. Use BuiltWith to find companies that are using your competitors or products that you integrate well with. 

4. Find if a website mentions a keyword 

Use the Google Search integration in Clay to find keywords mentioned on a page

5. Find if someone mentions a keyword on their LinkedIn profile or company page

Use the LinkedIn integration to find the summary and experience description of your targets and search the descriptions for Keywords. 

6. Find the G2 Ratings of your target accounts, their score, and their total review count. 

7. Find the target company's website traffic, traffic sources, and competitiors using DataForSEO

8. Automatically scrape a the people that like a tweet and enrich with company information

9. Find news events about companies using the PredictLeads integration.

urn:li:activity:7004148700570607616,"Cold email campaigns need to shift to 7 month long marathons rather than 2 weeks sprints. Let me explain. 

Most cold email campaigns that I see people running are between 3-5 emails sequence to end in around 2-3 weeks. 

The data clearly suggests that most positive responses come from your first two emails. Maybe the third if you use that to change the angle on your offer and this new angle resonates with your prospects. 

The tail end of most cold email campaigns are falling on deaf ears. And maybe it's not even your product's fault. The prospect is just not deep enough into the pain and needing to make a decision. 

Take Apollo.io for an example. For $99/month, they give you access basically to your own copy of LinkedIn that you can sort and filter through prospects and get emails directly from. On top of that, you can send emails directly from the platform. 

What B2B business in the world does not need that solution? 

The ones that don't know any better. 

Sure Apollo can send loads of emails and it will certainly grab the attention of people that know they need a database, but what about Founders that have never sold something in their life and they are operators/builders? They need to be educated. 

That's why I think we need to be making our email campaigns longer, lead with value in the first 2 emails but try to collect the bottom of the funnel people that know they are in pain. 

Use the emails in the later parts of your campaign assuming your speaking to someone that doesn't know the pain they are in. Provide them with resources of how to run a cold email campaign. How to acquire customers on LinkedIn, etc.

Codie has talked about in the past that she wants to invest in AirBnB property management companies. Now, me being a list builder, I was thinking about how I could build this list to do some Deal Scouting for her. 

The tough part about this list is obviously, most companies don't tag property management companies with AirBnB management. 

There's two routes that we can go down to build this list. Both involve using Clay 

1) Pull a list of property managers from any database you get leads from. Use the Google search feature to search their site to see if they mention ""AirBnB property management"" or even just Airbnb.

The search would look something like this. 

site:{{example(dot)com (""AirBnb property Management"" OR ""Airbnb"")

2) Use the Google Search feature as a source to find ONLY companies that mention Airbnb Property management on their sites. (Video Tutorial in the comments)

LinkedIn could take time to cover serious ground.

Cold Calling I may concede would give you slightly better insights but is more expensive and time consuming to get done. 

Email is the best place to test. Grab an Apollo.io account, get some inboxes spun up on Smartlead or Instantly, and run it up.

1. Keep the message short. No one is going to read a wall of text.
2. Tell them why you are reaching out, how you can help, who else have you helped before.
3. Keep your call to action to gauge interest. ""book a call on my calendly"" is not the way. I much more prefer, ""If we could help you solve this problem, would that be useful to you?""
4. Keep your subject line short and punchy but don't give away the whole email.
5. Don't use traditional break up emails. ""I've emailed you 5 times and you haven't responded so I'm letting you know I'm stopping."" Who even came up with this?
6. Don't put them on a 17 email long sequence. 
7. Lead with value. What can you tell them about their market, customers, or industry that would actually add value to their lives or business. 

What else would you add?

Threats

Spam folders are increasingly getting smarter and more effective at blocking promotional content. 

Sales Engagement platforms are making it continuously easier and cheaper to launch cold email campaigns. Hence creating a further flywheel for more robust spam filtering. 

Companies like Gated are keeping unsolicited mail completely out of the inbox (this is also an opportunity in disguise).

Prospects are increasingly becoming more frustrated with the amount of unsolicited mail they receive and are marking more emails as spam (again, creating a flywheel for more robust spam filtering).

Email sending platforms (Google/Outlook/Zoho) are becoming stricter about how much unsolicited mail they will tolerate in their systems. 

Opportunities

More interesting data sources are becoming increasingly easy to purchase or get your hands on. These data sources help refine your Ideal Customer Profile down to a more perfect fit ICP. Think turning a lake into a pond. 

Tools like Smartlead are helping prospectors escape the spam filter with a robust warm up pool and multi inbox sending powered by Vaibhav 

Apollo.io continues to add robust filtering straight into the platform with a crazy amount of data coverage. They just released intent data straight into the product as well. See Jennifer Rhima for more. 

And of course Clay continues to ship new integrations so that you can build your own databases. Use their Google Integration to find anything about a company you would usually be looking for. 

What would you add to the list?

urn:li:activity:6980964775077761024,"Lets go over how you can automate congratulating your first level connections on LinkedIn when they change jobs and organize this in your CRM.

All you need is Sales Navigator, Phantombuster, and Clay.

Step 1) Create a Sales Navigator List with just two filters. Add your first level connections and add the Changed Jobs in the last 90 days filter. Save this search so you can reference it again.

Step 2) Go to your Phantombuster account and create a Sales Navigator Search extractor phantom. Connect your account and add the search URL that we just created. Make sure you put this phantom on Watcher mode so that when it runs in the future, no duplicates are pulled.

Run this search so that we have data to populate our Clay table with.

Step 3) Once the search is run, we can start a new table from a source in Clay. Authenticate your Phantombuster account and pull the search into your table.

Note that the LinkedIn profile URL extracted from this search is basically worthless. Use the Enrich Person From Search LinkedIn Integration to find their default URL.

Step 4) Enrich the LinkedIn Company so that we have a domain and you can add the Clay Find Work Email Integration to pull their new email address.
Now you are ready to enrich this data with anything you want. 

You have their new company website, their LinkedIn profile URL, their company URL, etc. 

Everything you need to start enriching for your workflow.

Step 5) Push your data anywhere. I ended this workflow by updating my CRM but you can also use the Phantombuster Integration to send them a message on LinkedIn as well.

With this workflow, you should never miss another job change and youll look like a stud with your first level connections.

I will leave the loom video with the full workflow in the comments!

Happy Hunting!

urn:li:activity:6980612178886193152,"Does your email personalization end at {{First Name}}?

The bar for a successful cold email gets raised every day. As Outreach and SalesLoft onboard more customers, standing out becomes more difficult. Here are 5 personalization ideas that can be created completely automatically that give your outreach more spice.

Some aim to create highly relevant messaging for your prospects. Others just help question whether or not the email was fully automated or not. 

1) Add how long the person has held the role into your outreach.

""Hey Jared Robin, noticed you've been the Co-Founder of RevGenius since June 2020 so I figured you would be the best person to reach out to.""

2) Add how many roles the person held before their current one.

P.S. Vaibhav Namburi, noticed you held 21 jobs before you launched Five2One. If we ever connect, I'd like to know which one was the best experience that inspired Five2One.

3) Pull in technology from their website (points for pulling multiple that integrate with yours).

Hey Rohan Suri, noticed Nooks is using Leadfeeder when I pulled up the Builtwith Chrome extension. These tools are usually using their own proprietary data sets and adding another is going to uncover even more site visitors for you. Can I intro you to my friend Jesse Ouellette who runs a similar product that has been able to identify more leads than Leadfeeder for his users?

4) Mention an audit you did of their competitors

Hey Elric Legloire, noticed Calendly just saw a bump in traffic through paid ads and they recently added a TikTok ads pixel. If I made a video of their new strategy, would you want to see it?

5) Mention local facts or hotspots to get their attention. I like to mention the current weather, the top restaurant in the area, or the top attraction.

P.S. Rocco Savage, noticed you're based in Miami, have you ever tried KYU? I've heard amazing things about it!

Keep in mind a RELEVANT email is always more important than a personal one, but these lines for sure help increase reply rates and email delivery. 

Did I mention that all of these can be made completely automatically using Clay?

All of these could work, but Clays Google integration makes this pretty easy. 

We first start with a list of accounts and their websites.
Add the Google integration and use the search operator site:{{website}} wrongful termination. 

With this operator, we are telling Google we want to scan the website and only give us a result back if this website has the words wrongful termination mentioned anywhere.

The results will turn your ocean of Lawyers into a pond thats manageable and highly targeted.

Companies that have recently raised money is a great trigger to reach out to someone, but often the message falls flat on its face.

Most fundraising outreaches look like this to the buyer.

Hey {{First Name}}, I noticed you recently raised a lot of money! I like money, do you want to spend your money with me? 

In Clay, you can easily score a list of target accounts by criteria you would often manually be looking up. 

I had the opportunity to speak with Rohan Suri at Nooks recently and he had a great use case for this. 

Nooks is a virtual sales floor for remote teams (and they just launched a power dialer!). Their best customers 1) Have an SDR Team. 2) Work remotely. 

Instead of looking up each of these companies individually, I scored a list of over 3,000 companies by SDR team headcount and if they work remote. 

You can see in the video below.

The TL;DR is that I used the Get Counts of Roles by Company to find all of the companies with SDRs and BDRs. Then I used a combination of Google searches to find if the team works remote.

Build your lead lists, enrich your CRM, score your TAM all in one platform. 

I use it to add wild personalizations to my email campaigns and to find new leads automatically.

I had the opportunity to chat about what others are doing with Notion at Collision conference with Madhu Muthukumar, big things keep on coming!

3) Airtable

Another amazing tool that can bring your databases to life. Love using this as a dumping ground for data because it integrates so well with everything. 

You can also build better CRMs than most CRMs on Airtable and the Softr.io folks are doing amazing things to take Airtable to the next level. 

4) TexAu ¡

Amazing tool for those that have no clue how to scrape data. Speed up your workflow of scraping multiple websites with TexAu with zero experience required.

5) SmartLead

This is one of my favorite tools to send cold emails because it does not charge users per inbox and it has everything you need from email warm up, spintax, and inbox rotation. And it keeps getting better every week. The roadmap is looking amazing.

Why is this one of my favorite filters? Because LinkedIn groups is quite possibly one of the WORST community platforms on the internet. 
 
There's no good way to find the groups organically. 
 
When you're in the group it's full of spam messaging if there is anyone posting at all. 
 
The only way to see the post is if you go to the group and view the posts. 
 
And this is exactly why it's so powerful.

Many people don't know that Google is easily your most powerful prospecting tool because they don't know how to use it. 

Google search operators allow you to use Google to cut through the noise and return a search for exactly what you want. 

My top 3 operators are 

-site:
-inurl:
-intext:

Site: tells Google, ""give me everything that you can index but only on a specific site. Really useful for finding information about a specific company

inurl: tells Google, ""Make sure this keyword is in the url""

intext: tells Google, ""Make sure this keyword is mentioned on the page""

So now if you are looking for companies that mention enterprise pricing on their pricing page. 

You can search for your prospect accounts with something like 

site:gong.io inurl:pricing intext:enterprise and if no results show up you know they don't mention it, but if a result shows up, they do.

A little about Testbox -- 

The B2B buyer's journey is so broken lately. Buyer's doing their due diligence have to submit their information to get on a demo to even looking at pricing. 

Before they look at pricing, they have to have a meeting with an inbound SDR to qualify them. 

Then they have to schedule another meeting to talk about the features which at the end of the meeting *maybe* they will tell you the pricing or have another meeting to go over it. 

All in an attempt to see if their organization has budget. 

Buyer's deserve a better experience. Leading the charge is Sam Senior at TestBox where they are building a tool that allows buyer's to try software side by side to competitive software before ever talking with a Salesperson.

1. Ensure that you are verifying emails before you send. 

Many think that this is a step in their process that they can overlook but it has to be done every single time. Even if you verified the list 30 days ago, verify again.

2. Ensure you are not using Spam words

Even saying Oprah Winfrey in an email will trigger spam filters. Hubspot has a whole list of spam words to keep out of your email. Some are unavoidable, others you just should never use.

3. Ensure your DKIM, DMARC, and SPF are properly aligned.

Try sending an email through the tool you are going to be using for cold email to Mail genius and make sure your settings are right. 

4. Get a 95 or higher score on Mail Genius

This is an awesome tool to use and make sure your email is set up perfectly and you are not on any spam blacklists. It is my favorite because it gives you suggestions on how to fix your email if there's a problem

5. Make sure you are targeting the right people that you can create a relevant message for

The amount of email has increased tremendously since 2020. Make sure that when you are making the list of people you want to email, have a reason to reach out other than they are the CEO. 

6. Use tools to augment how much research you're doing on your prospects.

Use tools that allow you to mention something specific in your outreach. The best way to know where a company is going in the next 6 months is by checking who they are hiring for. Jordan Crawford has all of this data. 

Think about what pain your customers have, who do they hire to fix it, and what might they mention in a job posting that you can mention in an email?

7. Warm your domains

Warming your inboxes and domains is done by joining a group of other people that want to warm their domains as well and you send messages back and forth to each other which increases the reputation of the inbox.

If I had to start all over again with a tiny budget, here's the cold email tech stack I would use. 

First, we need to define the problems we need to solve. 

For a cold email campaign we need 5 things. 

- An inbox to send from
- A way to warm the inbox
- Data to send to
- Validation to protect our inbox
- Email sequencing

If I missed any, let me know in the comments. 

For the Inbox, let's use Gsuite so that you can use Gmass to warm up the inbox for free. $6

For the email warming, like I said above, GMass so that we can warm for free. 
$0

For the Data, there are tons of websites that have monthly free trials that never end. It'd be hacky, but you'll get there. 

Data providers with excellent free trials

- Apollo.io
- Seamless.AI
- Icy Leads
- Hunter.io
- SalesQL
- Slintel, a 6sense company
- LeadIQ

Let me know of any others in the comments. You can also reach out to Jesse Ouellette or Aditya Prakash who will definitely help you out. 

Now we need to validate contacts. Arguably, this is the most important thing to purchase and if you are getting data from free sources, you should probably invest in this. 

NeverBounce is $4 for 500 verifications. If that still breaks the bank, you can again use GMass for their free verification tool. 

You can use HubSpot, Airtable, Notion for free CRMs

Hubspot even lets you book meetings for free. 

When you're ready to launch a campaign, send it through the Apollo.io free trial. 

Now you have a 25ish email per day campaign going for $6-$10 per month.

There are a ton of factors that come into play when looking at email delivery. 

For example, your email service  provider is definitely looking at how youre sending the emails. 

Are you sending the same message with a different first name to 200 people at the same time? Your email service provider might start putting you in promotions or worse spam. 

This is only one piece of the delivery puzzle, but one thing you can do is use spintax to increase delivery. 

Spintax is when you tell your email automation tool to use multiple versions of an email to the same list. This way, your email service provider sees a different message every time. 

Most tools do it like this 

Hi, my name is Eric and I love {{outbound|email}}.

That would result in either 

Hi, my name is Eric and I love email.

OR

Hi, my name is Eric and I love outbound.

Mine?

Being able to use Sales Navigator to look into Group members Im not even a member of myself. 

Its one of my favorite because LinkedIn groups have terrible engagement. The members had to actually seek it out and join. 

Must mean they really wanted it. 

If youre looking for people interested in crypto, they might not talk about it on their profile but they could be in those groups! 

If you want more tricks for LinkedIn, I wrote a guide called Sales Nav Secrets Ill drop in the comments.

I was just speaking with a business that at first I didn't think I could help. They resell software that thousands of other consultants are selling. 

When coming in cold, usually this is a tough nut to crack because of how similar the offer sounds on paper. 

However, there are always public pain points that you can track and be the first to talk about in your sales conversation. 

This includes things like...

- Website traffic 
- Social media growth
- Employee headcount growth/attrition
- Employee department growth/attrition
- Job board data (Jordan Crawford has it all)
- What kind of tech is installed in their website
- What activity are they showing up with on LinkedIn
- Does their sales team have Sales Navigator
- Do they have any kind of content led motion
- Did they raise 12 months ago and are probably looking for some dry powder

urn:li:activity:6916752639791616001,"3 ways to level up your cold outreach today. 

TL;DR: Define your niche, reach out with a trigger backed by data, use an Ai tool like SmartWriter to level up your outreach.

So much of cold outreach feels like spam because your targeting is incorrect, you are reaching out to the wrong people, and you are not personalizing your messaging. 

Targeting

When targeting companies or people for your offer, I find most people are not using a specific enough niche. I think a lot of people are past the ""I'll sell to anyone that will buy from me"" phase. 

But now, many are still keeping their niche to ""Software Tech company that just raised a Series A""

Come on now, we need a lot more targeting finesse than just that. Why not B2B software companies that do not have a VP of Sales in place, have raised anywhere from Pre-Seed-Series A, and do not have a product led growth function. 

Little bit better right?

Now let's talk about who in the organization you should be reaching out to. 

Most of the time, I like to start with the Founder or CEO because the best thing that can happen is to have them delegate me down to the right person. 

Otherwise, if you have customers already, take a look at the roles and responsibilities of your customers. 

What are they responsible for? How is success measured in their job?  How large is their team?

Finally, personalization. For outreach with a contract value between $1,000-$5,000, I like to use 2.5 levels of personalization. (I say 2.5 because the .5 is the person's name. That is more of a requirement than a suggestion)

The other 2 are a trigger event and a personalized line. 

The trigger event is the event, factor, stat, etc. that qualifies this person as a potential buyer for my company. 

Hopefully, you have something much better than a funding round but that still works. This could also include mass hiring, layoffs, product outages, change of pricing, etc. 

I lead the email with this. 

At the end, I use a P.S. line by SmartWriter (Vaibhav Namburi is the founder) to really hit home that this message was meant for that person. My personal favorite is mentioning a restaurant in their area. 

Using even 1 of these will level up your cold outreach for this week.

A couple months ago, I made a post about how ""Winter is Coming"" for the cold email senders of the world.

Not just because of the way buyer's are reacting or because of the crackdown on Google and other Email Sending Providers, but the ""MOAB"" that is Gated

That post led to an amazing conversation with =ŒAndy Mowat and myself about the future of cold email.

As a person that manages at least 30,000 cold email sends per week, =ŒAndy Mowat and I were completely aligned in vision.

Sellers will now be able to prove the intention behind their email. They will be able to prove to buyers that they are not on some thoughtless email sequence.

Sellers can prove their message was very intentionally sent to a buyer on a silver platter, with a donation to their favorite charity.

For senders, I see this as an absolute win and will in fact save your company time and shorten your sale cycle.

In 2010, no one would have been caught dead without a gated e-book marketing campaign. Today, I believe most companies need to be focused on building engaging communities in service of their Ideal Customer's. 

Businesses typically have to alter to survive in times of extreme upheaval. Many others, on the other hand, prefer to wait for the tide to change before moving. 

A community-driven transformation may invigorate workers and put them ahead of the competition. It's a horrible plan. A corporation may improve itself through communicating to its consumers, channel partners, workers, government, society, and investors. 

Abolition of non-value-adding products and services allows for fresh project development.

Spending is maintained under control by concentrating all efforts on recognizing and satisfying changing community needs. This assists to promote fresh development and future expansion.

 Lou Gerstner revolutionized IBM precisely like this. To break up the massive corporation, Gerstner devised ""Operation Bear Hug,"" which required everyone in the organization to reach out to their most significant clients and find out their greatest issues. 

This discovery led to IBM's rebranding as the ""e-business"" corporation, today known as IBM.

In tough circumstances, people want to feel part of a community more than before.

In order to be a successful leader, it is important to establish good management practices right from the start. 

By taking the time to learn and implement the following tips, you can set yourself up for success and help your team achieve their goals.

1. Communicate effectively 

As a new leader, it is crucial to communicate effectively with your team. 

This means sharing information clearly and concisely, listening attentively, and being responsive to questions and concerns. In order to build trust and ensure that everyone is on the same page, regular communication is key.

2. Set clear goals

It is important to set clear and achievable goals for your team. This helps them stay focused and motivated, and makes it easier to track progress.

3. Establish procedures

Establishing procedures gives your team the guidance they need to succeed. 

Even if you think something is obvious, it's worthwhile to take the time to write great guidelines (for example, creating a standard work order or list of tasks). 

It can also help to ask employees what processes they would like established.

4. Create a culture of accountability

When employees are accountable for their actions, you will find it easier to make decisions and respond to challenges. 

If they feel like there aren't consequences for poor performance or mistakes, they may act with impunity. 

Establishing clear guidelines helps your team hold each other responsible without micromanaging or becoming frustrated.

5. Give regular feedback

Regular feedback is key to helping your team improve performance, increasing motivation, and maintaining good morale. 

Employees will feel valued if they can tell you are taking an interest in their careers, accomplishments, and work issues. 

Even informal feedback (such as giving hugs, high-fives or fist bumps) can be appreciated by your team and help to build a strong rapport.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6893564943770492928,,3 years ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,1.0,,,,,False

I said providing value of course. Forgetting that the feeling and the emotion that your product or service invokes is far more important than the stated and proven ROI benefits of the product. 

Everyone's brain is like an the combination of an elephant and a rider. The elephant is our emotions and the rider is our logical brain. 

The elephant moves left, the rider claims he wanted to do that all along. The elephant stops, the rider justifies that he needed a break. The elephant turns left, the rider says it is where he needed to go.

urn:li:ugcPost:6887781202762178561,"LinkedIn is adding a new feature that I'm very excited for! LinkedIn Audio Rooms are here in Beta! Here's 3 reasons why I'm bullish on Audio Rooms for LinkedIn. (Number 3 is pretty big)

1) The level of trust is so much higher than Clubhouse

Until the onset of Clubhouse, I had no idea millionaires had enough time to spend 6 hours per day on an app. Most of the connections I made on clubhouse claimed they had far more expertise/experience than they actually did. I'm excited for people to have to present through their LinkedIn profiles now.

2) Boosting your brand and getting in front of your audience.

This will be such a great way for people to collaborate brands and instead of posting together, they can easily run an event together.

3) You can invite people to an audio space the same way you can invite people to a regular event...that's right 1000 invitations per week to an audio event. All to your connections and can be filtered to increase relevance. HUGE

urn:li:ugcPost:6877287522150494208,"Many first time entrepreneurs are enthusiastic about their idea, but lack the experience necessary to succeed. The three most common mistakes that new entrepreneurs make are not focusing on their customers, spending too much time pitching investors, and they hesitate to build a team. 

These errors can lead to business failure if they are not corrected before it is too late!

-Not Focusing on Customers: Too often, first time entrepreneurs become so wrapped up in their product or service that they forget to focus on their customers. 

It is essential to remember that a business exists to serve its customers, not the other way around! Without customers, there is no business.

Spending Too Much Time Pitching Investors: Another common mistake is spending too much time pitching investors rather than building the business. 

-It is important to remember that investors are not the only ones who can help a business succeed. 

A successful business is built by focusing on customers and product/service development, not by chasing investment dollars.

-Hesitating to Build a Team: One of the biggest mistakes that first time entrepreneurs make is hesitating to build a team. 

Developing the right team will be essential for success, especially if you are an entrepreneur with little business experience or knowledge. #leadership #startups #entrepeneurship",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6877287522150494208,,3 years ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,,,,,False
urn:li:ugcPost:6875174639870509056,"Are you trying to grow your business or Social following? You may have heard of the $1.80 strategy. Let's talk about what $1.80 looks like in 2022.

Gary Vaynerchuk teaches and used this strategy to build authority and social following. 

The idea is to go into a hash tag of the audience you want to break into and leave an insightful comment (or your 2 cents) on 90 posts a day. Thus adding up to $1.80.

This can still be effective, however, with the rise of what some call Dark Social there are much better strategies now. 

BTW I'm glad you asked. Dark Social includes private groups of people that are congregating on Social platforms privately. Think Facebook Groups, Discord channels, Slack Workspaces, etc. 

These people join these groups to trade ideas, learn, and communicate with people around a specific topic. Often times a topic that builds an audience of your Ideal Customer...

Search out these Dark Social Groups and instead of start speaking in the groups. Ask questions, answer questions, build rapport. Leave your .02 cents all over wherever you can add value. 

It's so much better than mindlessly scrolling a hashtag full of garbage when you could be engaging with someone that needs your product or service right now OR they have a question you could answer. 

Try it out, and let me know what you think. #business #leadership #startups",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6875174639870509056,,3 years ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,,,,,False

LinkedIn is the best B2B database in the world. It has phenomenal self reported data that people are incentivized to keep updated. 

The guards at LinkedIn keep everything under wraps though so that you have to pay to play and it's difficult to take advantage of the platform.

They are always on the lookout for malicious scraping, automation, spamming etc. 

Normal accounts can only view 10 results per page at a time. Pay to Play users get a whopping 25 per page. 

LinkedIn URLs are so powerful that with them, many data platforms allow you to unlock so much information. 

So how can you get as many as you want?

Easy. 

Open up Google sheets, concatenate a search to say ""site:linkedin.com (Contact First Name) (Company Name)""

Take it over to a tool like Link Prospector and let it extract all of those search URLs for you.

Today, email senders are dealing with 

More competition
More Spam Blockers
More Filters
More email productivity tech filtering content

According to Mailgun by Sinch, close to 60% of companies have increased their email outreach campaigns since last year. 

It has become a science to get emails to land in inboxes with people needing consultants like Jesse Ouellette or Mark Shalinsky, PhD to have a prayer at hitting inbox. 

Gmail and Outlook are filtering all your content and creating new inboxes for consumers.

And what I see as the M.O.A.B. of all blockers to email marketing, Gated led by aptly titled =ŒAndy Mowat (Chief Email Officer)

So what's the answer in the future? 

I think as Sales and Marketers, we are going to have to embrace the future and roll with the punches. 

I don't think the Job Postings for ""Email Engineer"" are too far off from being posted (it may have already been posted)

I think we are going to have to embrace new forms of communication within emails to boost reply rates. 

Angel Sigman got me with a well placed dog photo.

AND we will have to embrace tech with clear user ROIs like Gated and be ready to either set aside budget to pay the toll or start selecting creative products on Sendoso.

In my high school physics class, we were learning about reducing friction and my teacher asked how much silicon should we use to grease model train tracks. 

She reminded us that you need to put on a perfect amount. Not too much and not too little. Too much and the silicon becomes it's own source of friction. Too little and the object won't overcome the friction. 

It's easy to get lost down the rabbit hole of using too many tools and every company is different. There's no one catch all answer for what is too many tools.

LinkedIn is an interesting platform because very few people actually post on it. (This is obvious because your newsfeed is still filled with fake activity like the fact that my friends are liking posts.)

LinkedIn rewards users that can post content that retains users on the page. Whatever you can do to stop the scroll will be rewarded by LinkedIn.

Alex Lieberman seems to be taking a twitter approach and using very few characters but staying punchy just like twitter.

Justin Michael is creating long form content that gives away 10% of what he usually shares in his micro-community, ""Salesborgs""

They of course have a revenue mode, but that is just to keep their solution alive. 

Our very best founders solve for problems they face everyday. 

So I invite you to start complaining about your life and questioning why things are the way they are. 

Maybe we can automate a solution, maybe we can connect the missing pieces to create a more enjoyable experience, maybe we can start a tech company together to solve the problem. 

Youll never know unless you start complaining.

Our grid would not be able to support everyone plugging their cars in at the same time every night. But what if AI was able to control who was charging at what time to be able to stop the grid from overloading?

Social Media has given people so many amazing ways to connect. I often reach out to my favorite authors on LinkedIn and can tell them how much I enjoyed their book where as this would have had to happen by fate in the past. 

But how do you stand from the crowd? Social Media has made it so easy to connect with people and this ease has made a tidal wave of requests from followers requesting influencers time and energy. 

Here are 3 ways to separate yourself from the crowd when reaching out to people with a large audience. 

1) Follow and engage with them first
It costs nothing to send a DM. Influencer will take notice if they see you giving positive comments on their posts.

2) Keep your message short

Someone with an audience has many requests at all times, keep your request short and to the point.

3) Target people that have deep engagement with the audience you want to attract.

When I first started working for CILA Labs, I read a book called Ask Your Developer that changed how I looked at tech related problems. The premise of the book was that everything is based off of software and the first thing you should do when you have a problem is to go to your tech developers and ask how they would solve the problem.

This got me thinking- Why shouldn't we automate more of the mundane, more of the little irritations of life?

Do you have a problem that you know would make your life easier if it was automated?

Yesterday, I spoke about creating a list of 100 people you would like to meet and sharing it with your established and new network which you can find here 

But who should you put on your list? Elon Musk, Tony Robbins, Dave Portnoy, Warren Buffet?? All of these people have immense connections and status but how would they affect your business? 

Unless you have a way to bring thoughts into the world directly, Elon Musk would probably not add too much to your brand and company. 

When adding people to your top 100 list, think of who is in your industry that is missing what you have or has status and expertise with the market that you want to target.

Thoughtful, targeted engagement is far better than lofty wishful, clout.

If you have followed me for a while you know I think asking questions is key to business success. 

This past weekend one of my favorite takeaways was from a coach named Alex Mandossian. He gave us phenomenal advice on how to grow our status. 

One tip I absolutely loved was to send your contacts a list of 100 contacts that you have identified as influencers in your target market. 

They arent someone with millions of 12 year old followers. They are someone with deep status and expertise in your identified market. 

So if you had a list of 100 people youd like to meet, who would be at the top 3-5 people on your list?

Technology is not unusual in the sense that it goes through fads of explosion and obscurity. One of the ideas that is getting the most traction is blockchain technology. The problem is there seems to be a misunderstanding of how blockchain technology works. For instance, every crypto is a blockchain, but not every blockchain is a crypto.

Then there is the problem of what needs to be a blockchain  Is it important enough to be kept on a database that every change is seen by everyone? How do we decide what is important enough to keep on a secure database and what can we leave out?

Do you have an idea that needs a blockchain to be secured?

Some businesses have no time for my phone call because they are so busy. FedEx has seen numbers that are usually reserved for the Holdiay busy season which has started this year in March. 

Other businesses dont want to hang up the phone because they need so much help from myself and the Chamber. 

I think in this video I could have done a better job conveying I understand the public health situation is dire as well and I firmly believe that we need to be listening to scientists about what needs to be done to control this virus. 

I was just thinking that we have already seen so much damage and with the fear of a second lockdown looking, my heart goes out to all of the struggling entrepreneurs right now. 

If youre in a business that can benefit from meeting a lot of new people, send me a message. Im in that business with both feet.

As a marketer, I do take this quick data with a grain of salt. If I got Gary Vaynerchuk to come on to my zoom call and he would be interacting with people, I know hundreds of people that would pay money to be on there.

As many people know, I have two brothers in the Army. I have seen up close and personal the positive benefits that come with serving in the military. From College tuition payments to paid technical training, the army has a wide array of benefits that many people can utilize. 

Every year, I send hundreds of students to talk with their local Army recruiting station. If they do not have a set plan to go to college and know exactly what they want to do, I tell them they should seriously consider the Army enough to just hear what they have to offer. 

Yesterday, I was selected among 30 other community influencers around NJ to jump with the Premier Golden Knights Parachuting team. They were an exceptional group of people and were great to jump with.

urn:li:ugcPost:6607671126510354432,"The first thing we need to realize about influencing and persuading. Humans are not rational. We operate on feelings and then justify with logic. 

In a study, a liquor store played French music or German music in particular days. French wine sales increased with the French music. German beer sales increased with the German music. When people were asked how they made their purchases they responded with perfectly rational comments such as A friend recommended it to me or I wanted to try a new premium beer. 

Be aware that people operate because of their feelings like an Elephant and a Rider. The Elephant is much bigger than the Rider and makes most of the decisions.

I encourage everyone to enjoy the discussion we had but since it is 7 minutes long, I wanted to sum it up for anyone that was interested.
 
Wanda is so exciting to talk to because of her see a need, fill a need mentality. When she witnessed a mountain of brochures that were being thrown away after a conference, she knew there had to be a better way to help companies reach their target customers. Her business is centered around getting content to the correct market and watching how the market responds to the content. On top of everything else, she runs a green company! Long before companies were investing in eco friendly content, Wanda was predicting the future and creating products that would fulfill the future companies needs. #visionary #marketing #gatewaychamberofcommerce #networking #newjersey #womeninbusiness #womenownedbusiness @ecofilesmobile",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6581978440033976320,,6 years ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,,,,,False

urn:li:activity:7076783124797419520,"I recently watched The Tetris Movie, and I just wanted to share some sales key takeaways I got from the film. 

1. Vision and Persistence: Henk Rogers was instrumental in securing the rights to distribute Tetris, a game developed in the Soviet Union, internationally. His vision to bring Tetris to a global audience showcases the importance of having a clear vision and the persistence to pursue it, even in the face of rejections and setbacks. 

2. Negotiation Skills: In order to secure the rights to Tetris, Henk Rogers likely had to negotiate with various parties involved. He understood the other party's motivations, finding mutually beneficial solutions, and maintaining strong relationships.

3. Identifying Market Opportunities: Henk Rogers recognized the potential of Tetris and its appeal to a wide audience. This demonstrates the importance of identifying market opportunities and understanding the unique value preposition of your product or service. By recognizing untapped markets or trends, you can position your offerings for success.

4. Building Relationships: Henk really wanted to make things right between him and Pajitnov, firstly because he had a lot of admiration for his work. Alexey Pajitnov and Henk Rogers shared the same vison and thus build a friendship and business partnership. He developed rapport and trust to secure partnership or distribution rights to bring Tetris to various platforms and markets.

5. Resilience: Henk was resilient, and he knew that he couldn't leave the country unless and until he made the deal. Henk faced a lot of challenges. and threats but he handled the situation with a lot of grace finally getting the rights.

Some say the story may be a little too dramatized, but overall Tetris is a fun ride movie, and it's a brilliant retelling of the events.

urn:li:activity:7003307465358393344,"Supply Chain Challenges for SMEs and Startup E-Commerce brands:

1. Data Quality - Data like master data, stock levels in actual inventory, and open orders are the backbone of supply chain management. 

Supply chain data availability, data age, and data quality are major symptoms among SMEs. If the data is missing, out of date, or of low quality, the resulting plans will be ineffective. 

2. Inventory Management - Small businesses face a wide range of inventory management issues. Customer expectations are changing all the time, demand is fluctuating, ecommerce is increasing competition, and regulatory compliance is more complicated than ever. It is critical for SMEs to have the proper inventory in place at the right time in order to survive and expand. 

3. System Automation: SMEs usually have limited IT resources, making it difficult to obtain the levels of information necessary for a competitive supply chain. 

Due to significant investments in traditional supply chain systems, most businesses struggle to get complete visibility, many small businesses are operating an inefficient patchwork of disconnected systems and apps. 

4. Shipping Partner Relationship Management: This may be complicated, with possible disputes over problems such as on-time invoicing and payments, late shipments, shipment quality, and so on. 

#supplychainmanagement When compared to bigger organizations, small businesses have minimal control over their shipping partner making it difficult for them to negotiate successfully. When the shipping partner does not have a tracking system in place for their invoices, the issue gets more problematic.

This is an issue that practically every startup faces: how can you convince potential clients that your product is the best one for them? 

They don't trust startups and don't care about your company expertise, so why would they purchase your solution?

Furthermore, if it's new, as most solutions are, they'll probably avoid it since they believe you're simply trying to sell them something they don't actually need.

Before you begin any sales attempts, be sure you have the answer to the question ""What's in it for them?"" 

This is the foundation of every global sales campaign for any product. People purchase the benefit rather than the product.

Then, if you're not confident they'll grasp your explanation, try explaining it in such a way that someone with no expertise of your sector can understand it.

Next, describe your competitive advantage - why they should purchase from you and why your solution is superior to their prior one.

Make the product as simple to use as possible, and provide a trial version to let your prospects understand what they're getting into.

Compatibility with their current systems and databases would also be beneficial. Remember to include this in your value propositions as well.

If this sounds daunting right now, and your team would like to focus on your product first. 

Pointer can help you develop a robust GTM strategy or work with you to find your Product Market Fit.  =H

During those times, I struggled with self-doubt, was constantly stressed, was always striving to prove myself, and dealt with team disputes.

1. Don't multitask
2. Don't pontificate
3. Use open-ended questions
4. Go with the flow
5. If you don't know, say you don't know
6. Don't equate your experience with their experience
7. Don't repeat yourself
8. Stay out of the weeds
9. Listen
10. Be brief

Here's how we can look at it. If you want to find clients or business opportunities on LinkedIn, you should think of it as an extension of your inbox.

We live in a completely different world now. It's never been easier to get in front of prospective clients. LinkedIn is FREE. 

Use it wisely. The quicker you act on LinkedIn, the higher your chances are of closing deals.

I would like to thank Ricky Pearl, and Ishan Mattoo along with the rest of the team for the training and preparation, as well as the continued support throughout this process.

I am looking forward to working with such an amazing team of people in addition to seeing what the future has in store.

Why work with Pointer?
Are you a founder or owner of a company, have a market-ready product, and need help scaling your sales?

If you are like any of our clients, the cost of building a sales team from scratch is a bit daunting. 

1) To provide the tech stack, salary, benefits, training and guidance will cost you $$$$$$.

2) It takes time (3 months on average) to onboard and ramp new hires each and every time.

3) You hire one person, and get one person.


Now with Pointer Strategy, the difference is clear:

1) Your tech stack is covered by us.

2) Ramp is as low as a few weeks, training on product knowledge and targeting your specific ICP.

3) For the cost of a junior salesperson, you get a C-suite team to build your sales program from the bottom up.


All our expertise comes from our various backgrounds in sales and marketing. Some of those include, but are not limited to: email deliverability, cold outreach cadence/sequence building, copywriting, marketing, consulting, coaching, cold calling etc.

With no lock-in contracts, we have to show you a return on investment to keep your business.

After working with Pointer Strategy, if you don't see an increase in your meetings booked (and sat), we haven't done our job.

However, we always do our job!

urn:li:activity:7092515700082163713,"Why are people still buying this? Stop. Now. 


Salesloft and Outreach are still the top dogs in the sequencer game. This makes no sense. 

Why? 

1. Horrible buying process. 
Had to go through an SDR and 2 AE calls + 1 SE call to get a 24h trial. For ACV of 1.2k. 

In what world does this make any economic sense?!

Who wants to buy these things after jumping through that many hoops? 

2. Inferior product
Simple emailing basics are just not there. 

- Multiple Inboxes per User? 
- Matching the MX records of the recipient? 
- Email Warmup? 

These tools are built by people who never sent an outbound email. 

And sold to people (managers) who also have not sent an outbound email in a decade

It's the blind leading the blind. 

This is also what keeps them in business. 
They sell to managers who only care about fancy analytics. 

Yes, you can very accurately see that your emails are not performing. Kudos =O  

And then people claim email is dead. 
It's not dead.

The big SEP will be, however. 


Meanwhile: 

For every 100 people we reach out to
we book 10+ meetings. 

With 5 min of setup work per campaign. 

BDR Teams are just lost.

Can you trust them? Are they accurate? 

Peakora dug deeper and analysed over 100 Startups. Turns out the vast majority does not invest in a correct HubSpot Setup. 

They just wing it. 

No wonder only 1/3 of all Startups manage to transition from founder-led sales to a proper Sales org. 

Why?

Operational issues:

- Failing to automate
- Lack of data quality
- Inaccurate and false reports.

You know that's crucial.

1. One tool can fix everything 
2. Sales is just a numbers game
3. Personalization is key


=4 Myth - 1 

One tool can't fix everything 

Why?

The question I get asked the most: 

Lanny, what tool should I use for outbound?

Honestly, It does not matter.

Michael Jordan was the greatest basketball player
Baseball? Not so much. 

It's not the tool
It's the player. 

Yes, you need tools
But you need to know how to use them. 

That's where most people fail. 

=4 Myth -2 

Sales is just a numbers game. 

I know companies that send 10x the emails that I do. 
And I book more meetings

Reached out to 83 people
Had meetings with 11

That's a 13.25% booking rate.  
6 turned into opportunities. 

It took me not even 3 hours of work to set it up. 

It's all automated now. 

I can re-run this campaign now. 
With 5min of work. 

Quality > quantity. 

If you efficiently create crap
You just end up with a huge pile of it very quickly. 

Good job =O 


=4 Myth - 3

You need to personalize your outreach. 

No you don't. 

People who never booked a sales email in their life tell you that. 

They are lost. 

You have to be relevant. 
Not talk about how you went to the same high school

Or that you stalked them
And think their dog is cute. 

Relevance > Personalization. 

Answer 3 questions

- Why you.
- Why me. 
- Why now.

Outbound is the most cost-effective marketing channel. 

Clients of mine run campaigns with a click-through-rate of 12.5%

Show how to do this with LinkedIn, Facebook or Google Ads. 

=4  Reason 2

Full control. 

Tracking your ads gets more complicated every day. 
You are at the mercy of Google and Meta, LinkedIn and Apple. 

With outbound all you need is an email address and your creativity. 

=4  Reason 3

Low startup cost. 

Ads cost you a lot of money upfront. 
You don't know if they will work. 

To get 10'000 impressions you pay around $350

Getting 10'000 impressions with emails costs you only around $83.

And I rather send someone an email
than just show up on their timeline. 

And we're not even accounting for the time & effort
you have to put in into creating the ads. 

Want to get started?
Here are 3 steps 

Step 1: Your Message
Fine-tune your positioning and messaging. Clearly communicate how you benefit people. 

Keep it simple. 
Make it tangible. 

Step 2: Targeting
Identify the right people, reach out at the right time and with the right message. 

Step 3: Testing

Getting it right will require some testing

- Start with a clear idea of what should work
- Test that Idea 
- Measure it
- Optimize.

it's about how you combine the tools
into an effective engine.

You can give me the best football shoes

Failure to pay attention to technical details of email setup.

Specifically 

i) DNS settings: DKIM, SPF, and DMARC.
ii) Not taking care of email deliverability.
iii) Not rotating your inboxes

=4 Mistake 3 

1. Hiring more SDRs without a good setup.
2. Believing that more SDRs will lead to more meetings.

When I did my first outbound campaigns we made a crucial mistake

We optimized our campaigns to get call bookings 
And sometimes ended up in calls with people that 

 Had completely wrong expectations.
 Weren't in the right mindset to buy.
 We're not the decision maker. 
 
As a result, 99% of them came with the show me what you got mindset to the call

Things changed when we made a crucial adjustment. 

If you want to close a deal, your prospect 

1. Needs to admit that they have a problem 
2. Needs to be open for help
 
Now, the question is how to find such prospects?.

Here are my 2 tips 

1. Validate the pain in your outreach. 
2. Set the expectations in the beginning of the call. 

Also, few things to keep in mind when trying to pre-qualify 

You need to see if you can help them or not 
Ask yourself 

 Do they have an urgency for a solution?
 Do they have the budget?
 Do they have authority?
 Is it timely?

Then finalize that with a 30-second call to the prospect to confirm everything, before finally moving to the discovery call

1. Structure Testing Approach 

Have a scientific approach to doing things.
If you are:- 

 Running ads
 Running an outbound campaign.

Always formulate hypotheses
Experiment & test
Analyse and implement the learnings

This way you will get better. 
Continuously. 

2. If you can't do it yourself, you can't outsource it 

Hiring an agency is good but 
If you don't have 

 Some success doing it yourself
 A clear idea of what good looks like

Your agency will run circles around you.

You cannot judge their work
And cant give them feedback

You set them up to fail you. 
And its your fault. 

Master it yourself first
Outsource later. 

If you dont know how
Get someone to teach you.  

3. Be the best at something - instead of OK at everything 

I wont help you with
Creating your ads, if I actually could
I will not run outbound campaigns for you.
Drive your social media. 

Ive done all that successfully
But I dont do it. 

I focus on one thing. 

Enable you to build your own outbound engine. 
Using AI & automation. 

And reducing manual work
While getting better results. 

4. Embrace tech even if it is very alien and foreign to you
     
  I still don't know how to code.    
  I can barely read HTML

Yet I can easily

 Configure APIs
 Send webhooks between tools
 Configure low-code automation.

The problems with most campaigns are

-- Not having the right tools in place
-- Failing to measure success 
-- Low meeting booking rates

5 ways to change that. 

1. If your open rate is low, you have a deliverability issue. 
Check your tech setup that your Tech setup is bad 
 

2. If you are 100% confident in your tech-stack
    Then optimize your emails subject line.
     Especially the first 20-30 characters.

3. If your reply rate is bad then, it's a message-market misfit
    You are reaching out to the wrong people.
    With the wrong massage.

4. if you had a successful campaign before with this audience,
     you are most likely not addressing a relevant pain.

5. If you get good replies but no booked calls
    Improve your follow-ups. Call the leads..

What other metrics are you using to optimize your campaigns?

2. Apollo.

This will raise the minimum standard for all emails. Everyone now writes decent copy. 

Companies are leveraging AI like never before 

  7 years ago scrapping data ( emails etc) was a huge problem
    Lusha, Zoominfo and apollo came along

  Then the challenge was email automation.
     Enter salesloft & outreach.

 Now the focus was on writing the best email copy 
   AI is solving this and will only improve

Now here's the thing 

With all these challenges taken care of 
The next step is to combine data quality, automation and copywriting. 

You need to reach out to 

 the right people 
 at the right time (using trigger events)

 with a relevant message that EXACTLY describes their pain

And if you don't have that context, 
if you don't have a compelling reason to reach out 

You are not breaking through the noise
You are adding to it

And your outreach campaigns will not succeed.

Before I met my beloved fiancé I did an experiment. Could I beat the Tinder odds?

The male-to-female ratio on Tinder is 5:1. That means 80% are guys.

And only the top 1% actually get dates from the platform.

Because most of them are just set up to fail. Bad pictures, lame messaging.

What I did instead

I started with some market research
- Created a girl profile to analyse my competition
- Reviewed what makes good profiles stand out
- Got inspiration for my copywriting & conversation scripts

The craziest insight was that a good-looking girl gets over 4k likes in 3 hours. I had no chance to read all messages.

Only the ones that stood out.

I then created my profile accordingly
- Funny joke in the Bio 
- High-quality picture of me doing a fun activity
- Conversation script to set a date
- A/B tested the opener messages & script
- Kept track in Excel & optimised

Ive increased my booking rate to almost 50%.

Generated a lot of pipeline but I did not find my love there.

Moral of the story: If you want to get the big deals go out and meet people in person.

I met my future wife in a bar in Zurich.

Fair to say I know him since birth. And his journey has been quite a ride.

I remember in Egypt in Jan 21- when we both escaped the Covid Lockdowns - he just started his new company RealGrowthHacking He looked terrible.

Early mornings and late nights took their toll.

But I knew he would make it worth it.

And so he did. Now it's May 2023 and his little baby has grown into a teenager, with 5 FTEs and an amazing community. And it outgrew growth hacking.

Time for a transformation. From RGH to Peakora.io

We always wanted to work together but never could find the right setup. Until earlier this year when something majorly changed on my end.

I love HubSpot & Sales Ops. But the agency world was not for me. Most of them (not all) focus on selling hourly packages and retainers - instead of building templates, SOPs and frameworks.

It's not just a terrible business model. It's bad for the start & scale-ups. They don't get enabled. No help to help yourself.

That had to change. Thus, I built a program that enables B2B SaaS companies to build & optimize their HubSpot following proven frameworks.

Peakora embodies that spirit.

 =IA proven roadmap and all collateral needed on this path
 =I An eLearning track to transfer all the valuable knowledge needed in this stage
 =I Hands-on coaching, project management, and implementation support by true startup veterans (including myself)

Very happy that we now found a way to work closer together. I'm officially one of their Program Partners.

Can't wait to enable more startups to build smooth and scalable sales & revenue operations together with Peakora.

5 years ago my former boss Ben Klein interviewed me for a Job as a consultant at BEE. 

As the last question he asked me the best interview question. I'm still using it to this day. 

""Why should I NOT hire you?""

I gave it some thought. ""What is a good reason not to hire me?"" 

The answer was very clear for me: ""I'm a character guy. I will challenge you. If you don't like that - then I'm the wrong guy.""

I knew what I'm like, what I wanted out of this role. 

If you don't know what you want - you have to take what you get. 

It's kinda the same in Sales. If you don't know your ICP, what problems you can solve - and which ones not. You are lost. 

And so will be your deals. 
Not won. 
Lost.

urn:li:ugcPost:7004393159761784834,"""Bitcoin is on the road to irrelevance"" - ECB 2022

That's what the ECB just said in their latest blogpost (see comments for the link). Multiple claims are just plain wrong. Let's see: 

=¸ Transfer of money
""Real Bitcoin transactions are cumbersome, slow and expensive."" 

BTC can be sent around the globe instantly and basically for free. 

Have you ever wired fiat money to your relatives in another country? Or a business transaction? Took longer and was more expensive. 

Also, not a single mention of the lightning network?

=É Ponzi Scheme
""Bitcoin investors have the strongest incentives to keep the euphoria going""

Interesting statement coming from an institution that has the strongest incentive to keep the FIAT system going. 

= Energy consumption
""The Bitcoin system is an unprecedented polluter.""

The opposite is true. BTC allows for the monetization of before unused energy sources. 

BTC mining cannot compete economically with the electricity sources used to power a city. 

This energy would just be left bare otherwise. It literally makes us more efficient with the resources we have. 

=L Social Impact
""Bitcoin provides no social benefits""

Tell that again to the Lebanese refugees who were able to keep their wealth and escape impoverishing capital controls. 

BTC allows for the censorship-free transfer and store of wealth. 

It allows incredibly easy access to the financial system for the 1.4 Billion unbanked people in the world. 

This is no social benefit? 

=@ Summary
""Bitcoin is on the road to irrelevance"". I guess the ECB has evidently a very biased view.

The public deserves to know better.  

Personally, I'm looking forward to having this quote hung up on my wall in a large, beautiful typeface in 2,3 years time. 

When the EUR is further inflated and worth less and BTC hits new all-time highs. 

What are your thoughts on this?

Imagine the following: The salary is okay, the working conditions tempting, so you want to make a good impression. 
 
On the first day, you report to the foreman, who gave you an axe and assigned you to a specific area in the forest. 
 
Enthusiastically, you set to work. 
In a single day you felled eighteen trees. 
""Congratulations,"" says the foreman. ""Keep it up."" 
 
Prompted by the foreman's words, you decide to surpass the result of your work the next day. So you go to bed early that night. 
 
The next morning you get up before everyone else and go into the forest. 
 
But despite all your efforts, efforts do not manage to fell more than fifteen trees. 
 
'I must be tired,' you think and decide to go to sleep just after sunset that day. 
 
You wake up at dawn with a firm resolve to surpass your mark of eighteen trees today. You do not even make it halfway. 
 
The next day it's only seven trees, the day after that five and on the last day you spend almost all of it cutting down a second tree. 
 
Worried about what the foreman would say, you go to him, tell him what happened and swear that you worked until he dropped. 
 
The foreman asks ""When was the last time you sharpened your axe?"" 
 
""Sharpen the axe? I didn't have time, I was too busy cutting down trees."" 
 
As Stephen Covey said, never forget to ""Sharpen the saw"".  
 
The story reminds me of a lot of sales people. You just do MORE. More calls, more messages, more LinkedIn.  
 
But you never look at how you can become more effective, what tools do I need? 
 
Sometimes less is more.

""I spend 4h cobbling reports together in Excel - each week!""

Stuff like that I hear way too often. So it was time to talk about how to avoid that. 

Fabian Hartmann from HubSpot invited me to speak at their Scaleup Workshop series about exactly that. 

After working over the last 5 years with scaling SaaS companies I've seen what works when it comes to building a good, well oiled revenue machine....and what doesn't. 

Not having your revenue operations set up properly ranks high on that list. I mean how do you: 

1. Accurately create reports? 
2. Making the right decisions that drive impact
3. Not wasting time with stuff that should be automated.
4. Give your sales team really qualified leads? 

Without rev ops, it's not possible. 

Are things running perfectly smoothly in your HubSpot? Lead Scoring? Reporting? Lead Nurturing? 

If not, comment ""RevOps"" below and I will send you the recording.   You need to be connected w/ me --> send a request if we're not. Will be accepted automatically. 

PS: This time the automation works, I've tested it :)

1ã Most mistakes already happen at the very beginning when the records are created. 

Either through manual imports or ad-hoc records being created without clear standards for what a contact, company, deal should look like

2ã Records not being updated/false information. This is mainly because someone designed a process on a miro board. 

Everybody thought it makes sense and agreed to follow that process. And then reality hit.

People are too busy to follow the process and cut corners. It all looked nice in theory but didn't work in practice. 

3ã Messy data architecture. Marketing, Sales, CSM all working on a different tool stack. 

Even properly integrated it's a huge challenge to get all data accurate. It's just fragile. 

4ã  Related to the second point.The end user has no added benefit for entering the data. They don't see why it matters to them. 

Thus, they don't do it manually. If you met any sales rep, you know one thing for sure: We don't like to do manual work. 

Therefore, setting up systems & processes in a way that your reps have to do stuff manually, will not work. They won't follow you processes.

Yes, you're right. It's bad. Really. How bad? 
 
The average data quality score is less than 4%.  
 
So why does that matter? Ask yourself:  
 
1. How do you automatically qualify leads?  
2. How do you assign them to the right rep?  
3. Know when it's the right time to reach out?  
4. Have a clear picture what drives your revenue?  
 
Poor data quality = poor automation  
= poor reporting 
= false insights & wrong decisions being made.  
 
I've created a template to assess your data and implement data quality in an easy 5 step process.

It talked about our journey at BEE Digital Growth AG from a small team of 5 or 6 people to now more than 20 fully committed growth experts. 

When I joined there was not a single salesperson - now we are 6+ people in the sales meeting. 

Revenue & deals are not the results of luck, recommendations, and the CEO's network anymore. It's a repeatable process, a system that delivers results predictably. 

We've recorded the session so that you can see how you can apply our learnings for your business and scale from 1m in annual revenue to 3m, 5m or 10m and beyond.

I'm looking for a sales engagement solution with the following requirements: 

1. capable of multi-channel cadences (linkedin, mail is a  must, phone + text would be nice)

2. integrates with HubSpot so that I can track everything in HubSpot  directly and not in the engagement platform (I don't want data silos)

3. Cobbling something together in Zapier is an option but only of last resort as it usually scales poorly. 

Currently, using lemlist. While it's certainly a great tool from a cadence perspective the integration/data structure of the platform is an integration nightmare.

I'm looking at Outreach and Reply.io. Outreach, however, already raised the white flag regarding the integration before we even came to the demo stage. 

Outplay& Salesloft don't meet criteria 1. as far as I can tell. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

The first month of the year almost over and so are your resilience and discipline to stick to your motivations. 

I know I'm right. Despite the proclaimed (and overused) ""new normal"" - some things never change... But are you really to blame? Motivation vanishes over time and everyday life sets in. To me, motivation is a luxury I cannot afford to rely on. 

If I'd only allow myself to do my sales calls or go to the gym when I'm motivated to then I'd never get off that next episode of the queen's gambit. 

What works is seeing yourself progressing towards a goal. It puts the large objective within reach and breaks it down into small tasks, small habits. 

They become routines and your everyday life. You just do them. Just like brushing your teeth. 

So to track your progress towards your goals I've further improved my OKR template over the last year and included a daily success tracker that helps you visualize, contemplate and record your daily achievements.

So Ive created my own. As an Excel  sheet. Easy to use, well-structured and brutally effective.

I've been super frustrated with all the articles on businesses and COVID-19 out there. They're just useless. 

It was only meta-analysis without providing practical guidance.

- ""Focus on your liquidity management""
- ""Build a task force to deal with this""
- ""Take care of your supply chain""

It's all true but also sort of not really useful. It's a bit common sense. If you feel the same way, here's an article I wrote to combine both: Fundamental Analysis and then practical, hand's advice for managers on what to focus on and how to act specifically.

It's based on fundamental research, especially using data from China where we can already see how the successful business acted differently to the ones that are now struggling.

Don't be that person. I know 100% of the people here on LinkedIn can relate to this. A friendly, unsuspicious connection request. Sure, let's connect. But then you realize it's a trojan horse, a devil in disguise.

After the connection here it comes; the immediate pitch:

""Hey Lanny, I have this amazing thing for you. It can do X and Y & Z....and did I tell you its awesome and it can even cure cancer! Its so awesome. Buy it. Buy it NOW! When are you free to call? Next Tuesday ok? An invite is already sent, looking forward to it! Best regards, Tom""

You're probably smiling now. Because you know it's true.

Honestly, I don't have an issue with people reaching out related to business stuff, that's what we're here for.

But please, take me on a date before we hook up. 

Establish that I even have the problem your awesome product tries to solve.

I don't need the cure for cancer if my arm's broken. As awesome as killing cancer is, I don't need it. So don't sell it to me.

Trust me, you will sell more this way. And annoy the rest of us less. Thanks

I'll never forget watching Kobe's last game. 3 Minutes to and the Lakers are down by 10pts. Kobe losing his very last game? Never! Not on his watch. What happened next?

 
Exhausted, barely able to walk but. He used his secret weapon. By the sheer force of will, he turned that game around and dropped 60 pts! The Mamba Mentality.

 
Playing Basketball as a kid I idolized him. There were many great players but he was the one for one specific reason.

 
His hyper-competitiveness. This guy did not step on the court to win. He went out there to crush his opponents.

 
Hearing stories about him showing up at 4 am on game day to be there before anyone else to practice and staying 2h after the game as well was just >/>/.

 
My Dad always told me: ""Lanny, you can have everything you want - IF you are willing to put in the work!"" And there was a guy who REALLY put in the work.

A decade ago I wasn't a lot of things. And a lot of things I hadn't experienced. 

- Not finished my apprenticeship in Banking at UBS
- Hadn't finished my degree University of St.Gallen
- Didn't live in another country
- Hadn't started my own event management firm and failed after 1 year
- Didn't have a breakdown because I hated what I was doing
- Didn't know where I was going 
- Didn't realize that time is the most precious thing

And where am I today, 31.12.2019? A bit older, a bit wiser and yet still there are more things that I haven't done yet.

In some sense, we are our past and our present but in a weird sense we are also our future, we are what we are not yet to speak in existential terms. So I wonder what my list in 2029 will look like? There are 3 things i certainly want to be: 

1.) healthy
2.) happy
3.) Impactful 

The first 2 are obvious i guess. What about 3? Just vanity? No, not at all. But being impactful is the side effect of being of value to a lot of people. What better is there to be? 

What are 3 things you want to be in 2029?

urn:li:activity:6596814595959201792,"""How can you compare LinkedIn and Instagram? They are so different?"" - this was a common critique I received to my recent posts. So why is comparable? 

Both posts went trending and reached over 30'000 people I guess I struck a nerve. However, the inputs are more than valid. I actually agree that they are not the same...yet. What people don't see, in the future..literally. 

Chaital Shah pointed it out perfectly as well. I'm a typical millennial and how old was I when Facebook took off in 2010 (the year FB grew the fastest)? mere 17 years old. Did I care about my career? Not really. How about Instagram; how old was I when it took off in 2014? 21 years old. Interested in business relationships? Not that much, I just started uni and exams and parties were the top priority. 

Now in 2019, I'm 26 years old and business relationships became of key importance for me. I want to share learn from others, stay in contact with contacts from other countries and share knowledge to and have a lasting impact together. All of a sudden LinkedIn became interesting to millennials. The first generation that grew up on social media is hitting LinkedIn, a generation that understands the true power of the network and how to build a brand on it.

urn:li:activity:6593173342105280512,"Instagram is dying...and why your post on LinkedIn get's 3,5x more views. Even if IG has over 3x the users. 

 
My last post got crazy attention (15k+ views) and even ended up being trending on LinkedIn. Let's continue the series. 

 
The # 1 reason is what I call a social networks maturity. the early stage a new network new users come to the platform and create impressions (they look at content). And users actively create posts (content that can create impressions).  To answer the question ""how many people do see my post?"" we have to take the ratio of post vs impressions. Basically: how big is the competition for attention? 

 
Because not all people post content that ratio is positive and organic growth is easily possible. That's obviously very attractive for advertisers and big brands. So they join the platform with big $$. Thus, the amount of posted content starts to outgrow the growth of the number of impressions. Therefore, competition increases, organic views get viewer & viewer. Thus, users increase their posting, reinforcing the spiral. Furthermore, the network depends on ad revenue = organic reach is not in the network's interest.

 
This is what happened to Facebook in 2011/12 and is happening now to IG...see the statistics:

Thats all true & I totally agree. IG is still active and alive...yet. But IG is EXACTLY where Facebook was in 2012. What does that mean? Well look at your latest Facebook post how many likes or views did you get? Wow, 1 or 2? Same here. This is what IG is going to look like in 18-24 months. The indicators are clear & there are 3 major reasons:

1.) Maturity & User activity of the network
2.) User Demographics
3.) Monetization

This is based on a quantitative analysis I did. I will go through each of these separately and share them with you next week. For now, let me just show you something very interesting. Here on LinkedIn, I have 600 followers on Instagram I have 10132 followers (pls dont call me an influencer tho). I looked at the stats of my latest posts on LI and IG. Guess where I got more views?

In my recent workshop w/ Asendia & Swiss Post for BEE INBOUND AG I talked about exactly that and I wanna share some insights.

1. People want to BUY. Nobody wants to be SOLD. Especially here on LinkedIn. 

Does that sound familiar: ""Hey Lanny, we are the most awesome developer team, buy my stuff! I know you need it!"" - Me: *cringe* ""....ehm, nope"" 

2. We forget the most important part of social selling...SOCIAL comes first, SELLING is just an afterthought. 

I get it, connecting with people is tricky. What do I write on my profile? How do I find the right people? What do I even write to them without being salesy?

To answer these questions I've created a Social Selling Guide that provides you with:
- 9 point checklist for the perfect LinkedIn profile 
- 3 proven ways to find your right prospects 
- 4 Step process to successfully connect with them
And a lot of examples directly from our clients and us

I thought I'd share it here. So just drop a comment below SEND GUIDE and I ship it over :)

Telling 50% of the population - and basically their customer base - that their moral behaviour is deemed reprehensible and that they are basically all the same misogynistic sexual harassers obviously didn't go too well for Gillette. 

The intent was to capitalize on the social media trend surrounding social justice by jumping on the bandwagon  I guess nobody can disagree with the aims of equality of opportunity and that is not the point I'm making here 

The problem only was that pretty much everybody could see it for it was: A pure charade. And so the customers voted with their pockets. In August Gillette's mother company P&G announced an $8 BILLION devaluation.

CEO Gary Coombe, however, stated that the campaign was ""a price worth paying"" doubling down on the hypocrisy. Now you might ask: ""why am saying that and why in such a rather plain language? "" Well, basically their new campaign is proof: It focuses on a hypermasculine firefighter (Is there a more traditionally male stereotype?).

This is part 2 of the anti-how-to guide with the basics every marketer should know.  Otherwise, this is how it could turn own. Very entertaining but also embarrassing. Most influencer campaigns don't bring the success intended. Mostly due to the wrong set up and misunderstanding of the concept.

Having a large and especially engaged following on Instagram myself (@lanny.oslo) I could consider myself an influencer myself - I don't like the term though. And these are the examples why. A large audience should be used to provide them with something valuable, something that helps or improves their lives. Not just monetizing it for whatever product you got an offer for. 

Don't get me wrong, I am 100% convinced of the influencer marketing and its effectiveness. It's just about doing it in an authentic way. It will not work otherwise anyways. Not for the Influencer - nor the company that is sponsoring the posts. So here's a guide how not to.

The petrified-of-losing-their-job rep will slog forward like theyre dragging a sled loaded with 500 lbs

Theyll be less creative, with less output, and take away less understanding from their efforts than someone whos confident in their path

Outcomes are rarely certain - but we can know what we can know; and doing so at least gives a clear path forward 

One we can sprint at

That sprint means 10x output in 1/2 the time - it shortens feedback loops while performing them at higher levels of skill which means the information we get back is more representative of the truth ((rather than diluted by negative mindset and low quality actions)).

When you work for yourself you shed some common sales stressors like quota, the ability to be fired, and bosses who are not actual leaders

As a rep - this means youre probably better off in an environment where youre cared for even above one that is ripe for performance UNTIL youre adequately knowledgeable to not need support in your skillset

Founders & other leaders should be mindful of the environment they create - I see countless examples of leadership stifling results out of fear and scarcity.

Truth is - I deserved the injury

I'd actually been on a strong run & was hitting my weekly numbers with ease.

Throughout the program I had built momentum that translated to less and less focus on warm ups as I felt ((accurately)) that I didn't need it to hit my lifts.

This selfish thinking mirrors a lot of what I see with sales reps ((myself included)) at times who rush through their workflows.

One day when I was finally going for a new PR, my laziness caught up to me and ended up costing me 2 months of time training.

In sales this is like when you get terrible results from an outbound campaign & look back realizing the campaign inputs weren't done with care.

A little up front focus, some effort in building a great list, investing in data validation... copy that is deeply contextual & ""native"" to your target market... 

That's the foundation to a solid campaign - and time spent doing the little things with excellence translates to results improvements similar to what I saw in the gym.

Once I was back to training I deloaded, focused intensely on warm ups & controlled range of motion... I built back to where I'd been and breezed through PRs due to addressing the areas I had been lazy previously

Quick fixes exist. Hacks have an allure to them.

Ignore them.

A slow, stable base provides a stable, consistent future.

At its core the concept is about contrast; of the stark, visceral variety.

For the uninitiated, Supreme NYC is a skate brand turned pseudo-fashion brand known for traits such as:

- Really expensive T shirts
- Difficult shopping experience due to competition w/ bots
- Nearly instantaneous sell outs

How?

They know their audience - and of you scoffed at the prior lines it isn't you.

MINI has done similar leaning into who they are; they're NOT normal & are offended at the concept of being compared to other car experiences

 In B2B you see a lot of mass-appeal branding. Just today I got an email that Reese Witherspoon is keynoting for a well known conference...

Wtf does that have to do with CRM?!?

Same goes for content - mass appeal hits for some but there is often an underserved audience who feels alienated by the mass-appeal stuff.

When I write cold emails I am ALWAYS asking myself NOT how I can resonate with the entirety of an audience, but rather how I can embody the attitude of a hyper-specific segment of it & what would resonate especially strongly with them?

We're metaphysically implanting emotional responses... so it makes sense that going outside ""the norm"" hits better than trying to be all too tuned into it...

urn:li:activity:7069494100235845632,"3 ways ai is helping my business set meetings with target buyers right now:

1. Using Clay to create personalized snippets to inject into cold outbound emails.

Usually I am starting with a companys web domain, enriching it with LinkedIn data, and then using that to create personalized snippets.

An example might be asking for something starts with was on your LinkedIn profile and saw you  finished with something like <summarize what type of clients they serve and in what ways they uniquely help them>.

Its important to add qualifiers like use 4-8 words to complete the prompt, avoid jargon and buzzwords, or keep the language casual and conversational.

Once you create a prompt that produces the results youre looking for, you can plug it directly into a sequencer and send them off as a personalized field.

2. Notion ai in order to spintax copy.

After a personalized opening, often were using lines that make an observation tied to our CTA or give an example of a problem their persona may face.

Spintaxxing the copy allows us to write it once and send many variations of the same general idea. This keeps domains healthy & emails out of spam filters ((as opposed to sending very similar emails over and over and over)).

3. ChatGPT to interpret and brief us on email replies.

As replies from domains roll in, I have them filter through chatGPT which will categorize them by level of interest and provide context into its thinking and why it suggested that label.

This has made inbox management easier and context switching from email to email faster since we surface key information quickly.

""Hey NAME - who at COMPANY is happiest when your yearly sales target gets hit?""

It's hilarious how well it's been working for us - and here's why ((I believe)) it hits...

1. It's a fun question to answer. We transport them briefly to a world where they have succeeded in their yearly goal, and you tend to get a laugh or joking response back... aka prospects get a kick out of it

2. It's a true pattern interrupt. This isn't your average SDR opener, and you WILL cause a legit pause from prospects as they ponder the question you just asked.

3. It's step 1 of Justin Michael's RRM cold call framework. We are essentially asking ""who is the CEO of the problem?"", which in our case means who owns hitting yearly sales targets ((we are targeting Founders of smaller professional services businesses)).

They almost always answer with ""Well I do""...

4. We double down. The response to them usually isn't going into a pitch, but asking ""And are you more of a sports car kinda person, or a nice vacation type?"".

Again - we are doubling the fun question // pattern interrupt, which also builds tremendous tension & curiosity in what you're calling about.

This framework Ive used in startups, larger orgs, solo operations, and everything in between&

It starts with targets - define WHY you are even doing whatever it is that youre doing 

Then identify the strategy - WHAT do we need to do to accomplish this? Its crucial here to enable the person owning the strategy to do define this

Next define the roles needed - WHO do we need and WHERE in order to fulfill this strategy that we just defined?

Once we do that, we associate metrics to tell us WHEN we are doing a good job and when we are not; we want to avoid constantly pivoting what we measure & why - so spend time here dialing in the things that matter most

Lastly youll define HOW youll influence these metrics to be successful Aka the workflows you need to follow to win

I like a ramped approach

You can only have one main priority

Whatever it is - focus all energy here first

Once you have some sort of routine in place that enables success here, layer on an additional factor

I.e. once I am going to the gym three times every week, I will work on adjusting my diet; but until I am, I wont waste energy thinking about diet

This cures the #1 reason people dont achieve their goals

Lack of focus

If you balance 10 things its easy to give the excuse of why youre dropping the ball; you have a ton to manage!

But if you have ONE single goal - laser focused&

It becomes unacceptable ((and less likely)) that youre totally blowing it

Heres the play:

- zero in on one goal
- share it with those close to you
- check in regularly with progress
- solve the real issue if not making progress
- layer on additional goals as you gain momentum

Ever miss 10 goals at once?

Robert Oppenheimer - whos son was a client of mine back when I ran my own company - changed the course of human existence when he was called upon for the Manhattan Project by President Roosevelt.

This morning a text from a friend got me thinking about energy storage; particularly human excellence - and the energy we wield within us.

A nuclear bomb works by harnessing the forces that hold the nucleus of an atom together by splitting the atom to unleash massive explosive power.

What intrigues me is how this massive reaction starts with the smallest unit of matter - an atom

In an organization, market or any other collection of humans - the atom is the individual.

We can generalize across large groups of them and pretend that creates powerful insights

If Oppenheimer taught me anything, its that the big stuff happens when you take the time to go micro

Inside each one of us, and every human we encounter - forces within are ready to be unleashed in a hellfire of passion and effort

If we want to win in life - I think we need to focus on how we can actualize the individual better o accomplish nuclear successes

Management, capital and control wont be the means of accessing these powers though - which is good because it will be harder for a*shoves to compete in this human-centric approach

No more rounding out the edges

No more monocultural tech industry

Way more friction - a natural occurance of *TRUE* diversity - the kind that *doesnt* actually get invited to the table because it wont stand down when told to

2. I blocked every single political or news related account on all social media platforms

One SDR manager who can only focus on tactical cues, no mindset stuff

- email formatting
- words // read time // CTA // subject
- call scripts
- calendar blocking
- activity goals

The other one can do NO tactical coaching but gets to focus on the why & mindset

- nuance within ICP
- the dilemmas our buyers are stuck between
- importance of the problem we solve for
- mindset coaching
- message market fit

When the latter is solid, the former becomes a ton clearer & easier.

A lot of coaching focuses on the former because its easier to talk about

But I joined sales to get paid solving the hardest things imaginable

 guess even that goes back to the point that without core values and purpose -> assigning goals is tricky

Its easy to assume peoples goals are to crush it in their role

But behavior probably says something more like Tom wants to do as little as possible to get an acceptable outcome

Additive effort is the difference between a monotonous hell & snowballing forward

It came to be when considering the impact of a rep blind dialing 1000 random numbers a day vs really diving in to understand who // when // what // where // why and how these people might be open to engaging with them

Random dials teaches nothing if youre not getting a minimum viable result out of it

Its like closing your eyes and going to a batting cage

One of the biggest mistakes salespeople make is falling into a pit of blackpills and failing to show up daily doing things to make them a better performer the next

Examples of additive effort:

- calling 10 targeted contacts and asking some questions around their day to day without an ask for meeting to learn your ICP better ((Josh Braun  jobs to be done interview))

- segmenting your lead list further to be more targeted with your messaging & impact stories

- spending the time to enrich your data so that you have decent phone dials and other necessary info

- learning to speak with your targets vs pitching them

- practicing your presentation or call skills with other reps instead of re/inventing the wheel for the 32nd time this fiscal year

People treat learning as linear and like the lessons last forever; captured somewhere within.

It's easy to add a large count of learnings ((reading new books, downloading new courses, listening to podcasts daily)) - without much depth or application of the ""lessons"" we allege to carry from them.

Learning is acute - an instance of attained knowledge...

Knowing is chronic - a lasting & engrained understanding ready at our disposal

What's the difference?

Repetitions - Neuroplasticity - the replaying of brainwaves across neural pathways that widens those channels and makes future travel smoother...

Repetitions come from application - real world, full contact usage of knowledge in the scary unknown world outside of us...

I wonder how many reading the nth next book are merely delaying their necessary adjustment from seeing themselves as ""incomplete"" or ""incapable""?

Who may be trapped without belief they are whole as they come today?

5. Debate
6. Break Into Two

Welcome to behind the curtain

Early 21 I was spending no less than 10 hours per week on phone calls helping guide people through landing SDR or AE roles from non tech backgrounds

I had racked up a dozen or two wins and wanted to cut my time spent doing so without lowering results

I knew if I could get the same result win hike removing me it would be a big win

So I took student #2 ever, Barrett, and asked for help

You may wonder how someone who hadnt even had a sales role yet could help me write the worlds best guide for landing sales roles, but its easy

He was the market

Smart, hard worker, coachable, gritty and had no f*ckin clue what to do next

The way we worked was almost interview style - and mostly asynchronously 

Id write big chunks of info - send to him - get feedback on clarity and impact - and we iterated on it a few times

Id never have been able to make it as well as I did otherwise

Having fresh perspective and a less expert ((gag)) lens of it made sure I simplified and slowed down where necessary - but also sped up where I got into the weeds

A good collaborator isnt about someone equally talented or better than you - its about having a perspective that strengthens the work process

Its about critique not agreeance

Its antifragile

Anti brands: make consumption difficult in order to build affinity with their intended sub-market

Supreme - release one-off, expensive drops seasonally. The resale market can be 10x the retail costs the weeks following a drop. The exclusivity increases the perceived value above supply and thus a powerful anti brand is built

Mini Cooper - marketed itself as difficult to fit into and invited people to try to fit themselves into their cars. The sporty rc-esque cars wont be getting any Kevin Durant endorsements, but is a nice choice for the vertically conservative who appreciate MPGs and ease of parking

Not all roles are alike (duh)

This A/B test on what the roles primary day to day life is going to be like will save a ton of headaches

1. The Executor - these roles are for someone who wants to come in and execute. Theyre most appropriate for newer salespeople, though they also have the highest earnings potential so many more senior reps take them.

The distinction here is that the role is filled to place someone into a workflow that ALREADY EXISTS and that is knowingly working to some degree. Its a role player position.

Do x - and youll earn y (mostly)

Being a BDR at salesforce would be like this - no one is reinventing any wheels - show up - run the playbook - execute

2. The Builder - these roles are for someone who wants the challenge of building out and proving a function. It can be a very challenging role with lots of risk, but observationally it seems to stimulate and fulfill sales artists or people with more expertise // experience.

Theyre inappropriate for newer reps oftentimes, because they lack the guard rails to help you through early learning curves that are provided by larger orgs. Its easier to fail. Its harder to understand what is even going on - Ive seen many people burn out in these roles.

Generally, its a company hiring a role to fill a BUSINESS NEED. Uh oh& that means the board is focused on it, the ceo is& and it also likely means no one before you was all too excellent at it either >#

Many such cases of CEOs hiring salespeople to drive revenue when theres fatal flaws in product, marketing or elsewhere that are completely outside of the reps control.

My advice is that newer reps should probably find more of the former, and the latter needs to be scouted out well to know whether theres enough resources behind the project to even work out.

Know whether youre filling a role that exists // taking over a workflow, or whether youre creatine // experimenting with one.

Negotiate pay based on this - builders have a more volatile path to hitting goal - higher base and lower variable as a % might be more appropriate depending on the situation&

I personally prefer builder roles - theyre great for entrepreneurially minded people - I see Erik McKee obviously as another example of someone who is pulled towards building& what great company to be in right?

2. it uses you phrasing instead of I, which in theory resonates more with readers and imo does help land your personalization better

Bonus is it brings the tonality down from corporate into speaking level& and aligns to how I would talk versus write something formally

Its good for preview because depending on your subject, pushing your personalization too far into the copy might mean its only seen if your email is opened&

The copy after obviously still has to hit and have relevance, but this helps make it feel like its meant for your prospects rather than a cold ask

A valuable lesson my dad taught me early on:

Really important when I was selling pairs of speakers surpassing my yearly earnings.

So when the person with a $3M home goes shopping for in-home audio experiences - youre missing the point if you focus on what your preferences are and what you do yourself

One of the biggest issues I see in companies or teams is silod responsibility

I see it constantly with SDR teams being under utilized

The worst situations is when companies rally around goals that dont actually drive desirable outcomes - and it happens all the time

To me, roles like Revops or chiefs of staff are great ways to join these various business units and align them to creative go-to-market strategies

If you hire great people with high creativity but extinguish it all with job descriptions, best practices and rules of engagement that arent build to capture the value that person brings

I also want to thank Jocelyn Tsai, Braedon Leslie, Teija Bean, Pavel Gorin, Justin Gurtz, Elibetsy Herrera Chong and Ketan Seetha for everything - you all taught me a lot about how products are made and go to market.

In Product - it prevents your designer and lead dev from understanding each other and having a productive conversation

In HR - it is why benefit renewals or onboarding or comp plan paperwork is always being chased down at the 11th hour

In the C-Suite - it's why there's sudden stress and urgency

Yesterday the universe lost a legend.

This quote powerfully aligns the world of lifting to professional performance where oftentimes fear of the next step is our main limiting factor.

Whether Im coaching sellers, discussing strategy with founders, or helping people teams craft feedback loops to understand their next move - its always the right move to do what you can now, next

I say this not from a place of authority so much as reflection.

For those who arent familiar - Louie founded Westside Barbell and developed the conjugate method of strength training to maximize output in strength athletes.

His methodologies focus on max effort ((load)) days and dynamic effort ((volume)) training days in a 4 day split

Heres how youd copy similar methods:

Mon: High Effort (low reps, high intensity)
Tues: High Volume output
Wed: High Effort (low reps, high intensity)
Thurs: high volume again
Fri: flex based on weekly goal being me

Whats great is that this effort schedule is universal to all effort based tasks - and a legitimately good program

For learning guitar Id read tabs Monday, play that off memory Tuesday, read tabs Wednesday, play again off memory Thursday, and then send a drift video of me doing it Friday to Patrick William Joyce for feedback

((Literally this easy))

1. List out the traits salespeople need to succeed. 

Justin Michael says Grit, Adaptability and Coachability are the top 3. I would add problem solving, curiosity and communication if I was interviewing as an SDR.

2. Write out a story for each of these traits highlighting the behavior you displayed and the impact it made for interview stories.

3. Write out a resume using a Canva template that displays the above traits and highlights any numerical achievements you have (100%+ attainment, top of team in something, etc)

4. Use Linkedin or Vouris job board to find open sales roles. Usually there are THOUSANDS available remote in the US, so you'll need to organize your data in G-sheets or something like that.

5. Once you find a role, also add to your database the contact (linkedin only works, but adding email by using Seamless.AI will increase win rates) info for the hiring manager ((doesn't have to be perfect, just guess your best)).

6. Now reach out using copy similar to what =� Will Allred posts about email, but maybe shorten even further for LinkedIn

7. Open with personalization and relevance, and close for ""interest"" in next steps like ""Hey Kellen, saw you're hiring SDRs - hoping to connect to ask a few questions about what you look for in top performers?""

8. Be genuine, curious, and if there's a fit based on your convo - ask how they recommend you apply for the role. They will tell you, and you're now a stand out talent based on how you engaged them.

Yet, despite this, it doesnt mean they dont give employees happiness and well-being the old college try.

Everyone else, including Big Ben, the 255 pound Account Executive who is a diehard Colts fan and cant touch his toes if his promotion depended on it, who is also suffering from a bad anger problem that he really needs to go to therapy for, isnt exactly jumping at the opportunity to downward dog his way out of burnout.

And for our brand new website, it was exactly what we were looking for.

We use these d*mn things everywhere.

Disastrous.

Capability: what you can ~ do ~

Capacity: what you can ~ endure ~

Capability speaks to information weve already retained and situational problem solving abilities.

Capacity is what we can take in *now* and fluctuates based on environmental factors.

I have the capability to squat 350 lbs, but my capacity to do so is reliant on adequate sleep, diet, warm up, desire, etc.

You are likely accurately identifying capability gaps, but craft trainings or coaching cues with assumptions based on capacity - which is the delta between the changes you want and the changes you get.

I see it as executive enablement; similar to sales enablement but attached to an executive with a shared goal of execution of a vision.

In my case, I was hired so that (Bryan + Kellen) = 3x Bryan.

It's kinda the best job in the world...

I bring sales expertise and customer buying perspectives to the team that we lack otherwise, but the way I ""deploy"" those expertise tends to be more like an internal consultant.

Chief of Staff mirrors management roles in that you organize and align people, and look for ways to be the WD40 of what they do.

Chief of Staff is a strategist who takes part in executive decision making.

Chief of Staff carries on certain projects on their own and needs to have TONS of trust between them and their partners so that it becomes EASY to delegate to them rather than difficult.

It works well because I get to put to use the exact types of lessons I ""sell"" with LEON; how to change the way we do things to improve results and help people happily succeed in them.

If the role interests you, a couple others that I love are Annie Gilbert & Mollie Fleury - both of whom have very unique roles within their org that differ from mine, while encapsulating a lot of the same thematic responsibilities.

urn:li:activity:6892189102989799424,"Happy, healthy employees perform best.

But what happens when someone inevitably *isn't* happy, or is struggling with something else, and you need them to perform?

First the framework:

""HEALTH"" can represent immediate state of being. High happiness means people feel good about facing their work, and are likely to be focused, productive and engaged.

The problem is it is volatile as f**k.

Like, ""I was on cloud 9 four minutes ago but just had a deal fall through and now I am miserable but have a call in 12 minutes to close one that I don't feel great about..."" volatile.

Nightmare scenario - this person needs to dig deep to show up fully ""on"" to close this new challenging sale...

Enter ""RESILIENCE"" - or one's ability to succeed and display effort despite low ""HEALTH"" or short term volatility.

I refer to this as your ""insurance policy"" against short term volatility -a highly resilient person will be engaged and productive despite felling poorly, where low resilient people won't be.

I have had exactly ZERO discovery calls where a manager had immediate access to week over week data on Health and Resilience of their people to ensure they coach them to succeed through their CURRENT CAPACITY.

Thankfully, (shoutout the managers out there), y'all do the most trying to support your people how you can.

That's where Bryan Smith and I come in...

1. When youre leaving a meaningful, engaging comment on someones post, tag some people they may not know well to try to open up the conversation.

Comments expand reach, but engaging discussion expands impact.

A viral post with a platitude that resonates (fine by all means) isnt going to activate prospects and our network like an in-depth analysis a la Carl Ferreira // Refine Labs .

So bringing new, interesting people into discussions to create cross pollination of discussion is a way to truly help that poster.

It also makes you look good when youre bringing productive conversation to two new people.

2. Teach people something specific, that they can use today to improve in their role or life.

Its great to inspire people to want to do things like get healthier but chances are theyd succeed more often if that was adjust diet to be in a caloric balance, increase physical activity, improve self talk, and sleep at least 7.5 hours per night.

It empowers sellers to own the burden they sell against, by how good they are at framing problems.

For example, LEON helps address burnout & turnover:

If someone things giving me $5k for LEON (yearly cost) will save them having to backfill one additional role, it's a 10x ROI and they will probably do it.

If they think giving me $5k each year for the next 4 will help them scale from 50 to 500 people with 10% lower attrition, it's a 100x ROI and they'll give me a bunch of referrals too...

I was thinking if I moved 2 units it would be a win.

The product I made was focused on how to get a SaaS sales job, and it targeted non saas sellers looking to make switches to remote work.

The idea was just to productize some thoughts I had in order to help spread knowledge and make the career that continues to support me accessible to more people.

Heres some things I learned doing it:

- you dont need to know everything, just enough to help someone get to their next step

- filtering is more valuable than expanding for someone who knows no better (my audience)

- Its a great learning exercise to take an idea from early ideation to fully operating revenue stream

I highly recommend people go through the exercise, and Justin Welshs course will make it far easier.

1. Selling products while finding product market fit is WAY different than selling mature products.

2. The people around you probably determine your success levels (but it's up to you who they are).

3. Get humble. Identifying shortcomings and openly addressing them (quickly) creates speed to improvement.

4. Having a ""manager"" who really understands you is life changing.

5. Listen more.

6. It's really fun getting to work on things outside your normal expertise.

7. Remote doesn't mean alone. I have more, high quality conversations every day today than ever before; shoutout Carolyn Dorricott She/Her, CDSP, Sue Melone, Darren McKee, Dustin Rippetoe, Jack Ryan >�<�and honestly so many more for making my 2021 amazing. Love you.

So meet.... me =

I grew up in Northern California as the oldest of 3 boys.

My Mom is wicked smart (Master's degree) but got to stay home and raise my brothers and I.

My Father barely graduated high school but started a small business that provided for our family.

When I was 14 I met this girl Caitlynn (more on that later)

At 15 I dropped out of high school.

From then I worked full time and went to junior college part time.

I worked trade jobs and learned work ethic hauling spools of wire and heavy equipment.

I was good, so got promoted from assistant to service tech to lead tech to project manager to sales over 3 years.

But that wasn't enough for me, so I started my own company (at 18) doing the same sort of stuff (home automation systems).

Starting my own business allowed me to pay my way through college, and propose to that Caitlynn girl (she said yes...).

Right before I graduated, my father passed away - it turned my world upside down. I had to dig deep.

I did however, and launched a career in SaaS sales as an enterprise SDR - where I did... okay >#

I met amazing people, failed a ton, but found some success too.

Also Caitlynn and I's wedding happened.

After, I transitioned into an AE for an HR tech company for a few years. It was a great job, but I had the itch to be back in the startup trenches...

During covid lockdowns, I met Bryan Smith arguing with each other (nicely) on the internet.

That lead to me joining LEON with a shared vision for making people happier at work, while helping managers improve team performance.

Besides work and family - I love:

- Helping coach new sales reps (I got a few dozen hired over the last year)
- Lifting weights and training Brazilian jiu jitsu
- Developing people (helping them align their life to what will fulfill them)
- Learning new things

I'm blessed to be on the receiving end from some of the best mentorship and guidance in the world, so I love to pay it forward where I can.

I am happiest serving others.

Heres a huge hack to kick starting 2022 goals:

Start small.

I have nothing against big goals - but only 7% of people succeed on new years resolutions each year.

Instead, I think weight lifting provides a better model for improving ourselves (or a better model for how we progress through those improvements at least).

A new deadlifter may only be able to pull 135 lbs day one, but adding 5 lbs per week for a year (not easy) would get them to 395 lbs (a far more impressive lift).

Much better than being at 135 and exclaiming Id like to get to 395 by end of year

You see, a vague path to excellence will often underperform against a clear system.

So whether you want to grow your company, close more deals, book more meetings, or whatever else it may be for you role in 2022 to be GREAT&

Start small.

Execute relentlessly.

2021 was a year of putting things back in place.

2022 I feel like any and all excuses are off the table, so I am removing distractions as well and going all in on a few key areas:

1. My Family - over the holiday we got to share with our friends that my wife is pregnant (surprise =) with our first child, so that will definitely be priority numero uno

2. LEON - today marks day 1 of year 2 with the team here, and the roadmap for 2022 is lookin' sick - time to show up

3. Jiu Jitsu - last year this took more of a back seat than I'd have liked, so it becomes a primary focus this year

So when managers of salespeople want added urgency from their team in hitting goals, what are they doing to create it?

""I'll lower the TCV 10% if we can get it signed before EOY"" (sound familiar?)

This gives you the chance to reframe the way prospects look at their decision making process to possibly close deals sooner than otherwise.

In theory money is compelling, but in practice that is the case for people already succeeding more than reps who have room to improve.

- Extra time off once goals are hit i.e. ""If we hit 2021's goal, we'll do half-Fridays all of January to help recover from the sprint

- Team incentives for collective 100% attainment i.e. incentivize top performers to help make a difference in those falling short of goal (if they have the capacity/desire)

- Lower the goal temporarily to make attainment ""feel"" easier and start building back the confidence to hit goals week over week

Like Gong does for sales calls and Lavender does for email; LEON provides a new lens of data on your #1 growth lever - your people.

Bryan Smith put together a (FREE) questionnaire system in Notion for you to collect this data yourself with information on how to use that data to support or challenge your team as is appropriate.

In essence it will give you a framework for the current ""capacity"" of your people to work harder, learn new skills, and hit goals; all while having mechanisms in place to alert if things start to go sideways (uhhhh... hello burnout?).

Check it out below, or hit me up if this sounds good but you'd rather let us handle this data collection and insight extraction process on your behalf.

urn:li:ugcPost:6866049124144443392,"Active recovery is a remote workers best tool to fight burnout while succeeding in their role.

Theres 3 pillars of training that affect load or the strain you feel on a daily/weekly/monthly basis:

Volume - the amount of reps or activities you do. 100 calls is more volume than 50.

Intensity - how difficult or focus intensive each of those reps are. 30 personalized emails using Lavender is more intensity than automating 100 generic ones (and more effective!).

Skills Practice - addition of new skills and practicing components of the real job. Upskilling, L&D, role plays& these should all be layered in strategically when an individual is most ready to receive them

So back to active recovery&

When you are feeling a bit stressed, you can recover usually by lowering volume and leaning on intensity to be effective.

For a weight lifter it means hitting heavy triples for a session instead of 5x5, and for me it means less volume for sales calls but more strategic focus on the ones I do have.

I also like to surround myself with beautiful environments that promote positive emotional responses&

They basically do the same thing each week and month, with the same goals& its pretty simple yet they still end up feeling stressed out. Im not sure how much simpler it could be

Well as it turns out, that simplicity is part of the problem.

As correctly identified, monotony leads to burnout.

What this sales leader hadnt yet thought about was their ability to affect monotony.

When a rep has the same goals weekly, monthly, yearly& you are framing each day as identical to all others.

The stress signal associated with that day increases over time, like a droplet of water on your forehead. 

Eventually its unbearable.

A way of hacking this is by having dynamic goals and taking a periodized approach to your working schedule.

By having a mix of variable stress levels on a daily/weekly/monthly basis, you can plan sprints or periods of high output around business strategy.

It also lets you place recovery periods where it has the lowest business cost i.e. slow periods during times of lower activity.

In both cases - you are leveraging stress or recovery to come at the greatest benefit to the company at any given time.

The result is a team that feels cared for, hits goals more frequently, and does so at a lower cost or stress level.

Its no surprise that this exact same sort of approach is used by your favorite athletes to put up big numbers while avoiding injury either, since in both cases youre balancing expected load against capacity to perform.

Or in this case squeeze that extra 20% out of your team's performance, provide them adequate time to recover from the sprint, and arrive at month's end goal without sacrificing burnout.

The yellow and green line below shows ""ok"" performance; the team is cruising along hitting about 90% of goal.

The purple line shows how a well timed realignment to a stretch goal, a willingness to sprint extra hard for a week, and then giving some extra recovery opportunity on the back end of that sprint can help you beat your goal without sacrificing your people's health.

The devil is in the details here.

First your team needs to be physiologically prepared to push extra hard. If they're already spent from last month; doing so will run you deeper into a deficit and be even more likely to cause churn or chronic burnout issues.

Then, if you sprint too hard, you may struggle to recover and end up sacrificing performance outside of your focus sprint. This means you could take out so much from your team that they aren't prepared to show up again next month/quarter.

Leaders can also damage their leadership capital by failing to adequately and proportionally support their people after the sprint compared to what people put in. The team will notice.

It's no secret that I'm an advocate for using data to tell you when, why, and in what ways you challenge and support your team; but the most important takeaway is this:

Everything you do comes at a ""cost"" to people's state of being (see: health // mental health).

As leaders, coaching people through how to balance that ""load"" is the most impactful thing we can do.

It's one thing to tell someone they can do something, give them the tools to do it, and pray together...

I have already started, and it feels great!

In our recent study where more than 100 Startups took part, we found that 64% of Startups really struggle to make the move from Founder-Led Sales to Sales Organisation.

A big reason for that is definitely also because only 36% have invested into a professional set up of their CRM.

Without having the sales processes defined and operationally implemented in the CRM. How can we expect that our sales reps can repeat the same results the founders achieve if there is no system and playbook to follow.

This week we start a Hubspot-Summer special together with Lanny M. Heiz where you get a free Hubspot Audit to:

=Ê Check your Reporting accuracy

Peakora - The very first Startup Enablement Platform <‰

What the heck is a startup enablement platform? Good question - Watch the video or read below!
___

In 2021 we started with RealGrowthHacking. Clients loved diving into our growth hacking program and the impact they got, but more and more we realized it was not the growth hacking part that they appreciated so much, it was the methodology with which we worked.

We learned that Startups mainly wanted three things when collaborating:

1ã Follow a proven process and work with people that have done this before
2ã Get impact fast
3ã Be hands-on and learn how to do it themselves

And this is exactly what our new methodology delivered:

=È A proven roadmap and all collateral needed on this path
>à A knowledge platform to transfer all the valuable skills needed in this stage
=à Hands-on coaching and implementation by true startup veterans

This methodology we call Startup Enablement, and following these principles we teamed up with some of the very best in their domains to create the one go-to platform for enablement programs that cover the most important needs in every startup stage.

With Peakora, we brought this vision under one umbrella and I invite you to:

=@ Have a look at our brand-new website and offerings (link in comments)
P Let us know what programs would be most valuable to you in the comments
=ã Reach out to us if you see the potential for collaborations
=¬ Let us know your thoughts

--> If you need operational support you go to an agency.
--> If you need advice you go to a consultant.
--> If you want true startup enablement, you go to Peakora

Hard to say, so far it does for us.

At RGH, anyone can work from anywhere as long as they work +/- 2 hours in the CET time zone.

Once a quarter the company flies everyone to a city of our choice and we all get together for a week of co-working and alignment.

This quarter it was Lisbon and the timing couldnt have been better. We've been working for months on what we're going to release tomorrow, and the past week in particular has been so intense and time-consuming that I don't think it would have been possible while being remote.

Its especially these highly intense moments I also loved back at Beekeeper, this tremendous startup energy, which unfortunately isn't the same when you're remote.

But with the setup we have now, I feel were making the best out of both.

I just got back from 2 weeks vacation in Brazil. It was the first time that I left the company for that long since I founded it.

I have to say I was a little nervous, but I now believe every CEO should do this at least once a year.

And I'm not even talking about mental health reasons. Here's what I learned:

WHEN YOU'RE GONE:

=Ý You identify what processes and ownerships are not clearly defined and thus represent obstacles to the efficient growth of your business

>  Your team is on their own and learns/feels empowered to make more decisions themselves while winning a broader understanding of the business

=i
=» You can quickly see which positions are understaffed and what your next hire should be

<Ý It takes 2 weeks to identify the above and also calm down enough to look forward to going back to work


I believe the less you are needed as a CEO, the more valuable is your company. And that's a nice approach to seeing what it takes to get closer to that.

I have to say I find it quite sad that most of the media attention is only given to startups for fundraising.

Or for winning awards, which unfortunately are often given without any real due diligence or are even paid for.

Of course, fundraising is a great accomplishment, but its also an obligation, and history shows it has nothing to do with building a truly successful business.

Thats why we thought about trying out a new format where startups share real numbers, real challenges, and real achievements.

Learn in the video (link in comments) how the CEO of Mila, Chris Viatte, and his team achieved these astonishing results:

=Unlocked high middle & bottom of funnel conversion rates by understanding channel attribution and user churn through implementing the Pirate Funnel

=È 10x User base growth within 12 months by changing the user acquisition model and applying rapid experimentation to the signup flow

While there are definitely some good answers to the first question, we're also discovering the second.

Last weekend our growing full remote team got together in person for the first time, and we had a blast wakeboarding, eating, drinking, hiking and brainstorming.

While we're still figuring out exactly how full remote work works, here are some of my best take-aways I hope you'll find useful:

=Æ Structure & Processes:
Done right, every employee knows exactly what their duties and responsibilities are and how to escalate if necessary. Tools we use: RACIs, checklists, and kanban board in notion. Flow charts, strategy, OKRs in Miro. Communication in Slack, 45min efficient team meeting on Monday.

> Trust over control:
There is no room for control. If I have to, its inefficient and I hired the wrong person.

=ª<üP Give responsibility, but also authority:
Ownership and KPIs give direction and expectation, but the person also needs to be empowered with the right authority.

>B=¬ Remote Culture:
I think the importance here is clear, but even more so in full-remote. It is important that we hire the right people with the right mindset who actually want and appreciate such a lifestyle.

>Í<û
@>ÍMeet in person:
For me I want to work with friends. And friendships just aren't made remotely. Not at remote coffees or other remote events. So we try to get together every quarter and then really focus on spending time together and having bonding experiences.

There is definitely a lot more to learn and I look forward to some comments that may help! 

But most importantly, I want to thank my amazing team for all their efforts and the journey we've had together. Going from zero in January 2021 to managing up to 27 clients at a time while ensuring the highest quality for our clients and achieving an NPS of 9/10 so far this year!

urn:li:activity:6942762088423436288,"One of my first and biggest mistakes as a young entrepreneur back at university was, that I thought having a business means founding a GmbH or an AG.

So that was what I did, paid a lot of money to institutions and locked up quite some money in this new legal identity, but a business I still did not have.

Today I do things differently. I start any new project as an ""Einzelfirma"" (sole proprietorship) and once it becomes a real business with customers, then I install the proper legal identity.

That's how I started as well with RealGrowthHacking and I'm happy to announce that since a few days we changed the legal identity to the newly founded RLGH AG that now powers the brand =€

But honestly, the legal change is not even a milestone, it's only a means to fuel the business further.

The true milestone is, that we started with only an idea in January 2021 and are now well on track to reach half a million in revenues this year - fully bootstrapped and profitable.

urn:li:activity:6914835049116823552,">à The first steps to take when going Product-Led:

I remember back in 2017 as we made the first steps at Beekeeper towards Product-Led Growth (PLG: a go-to-market strategy where you use your product as the main vehicle to drive acquisition, activation, and retention).

There was very little guideline on how to do it, and it was even harder to convince marketing, sales, and product that this is an important step to take for a B2B SaaS company.

Luckily, today we have the clear proof from many leading companies that it is one of the dominant go-to-market strategies to go after, and also way more experience and guideline in how to do it.

Nevertheless, PLG remains one of the hardest things to implement successfully, so I wanted to share some tips with you:

1. Build a team =o
B:
To go Product-Led you need a cross-functional team. You need to have marketing, sales, and product on board, and make sure you all have a common understanding for PLG and are well educated in this new topic. Without this support, you're not getting anywhere.

2. Define your strategy _:
I see too many companies jump right into implementing something, without actually analysing which PLG Model is the right one for them. There is a clear framework on how to do this, and picking the wrong model can do more harm than good.

3. Identify user success <:
A successful PLG Model is all about bringing the user to the moment where they realise meaningful value in your product. That means 1. you need to attract the right user, 2. understand in detail what they truly want, and 3. deliver an experience that truly solves their pain as fast as possible. Missing on one of these points is missing all of it.

4. Taking first steps before taking a swing ’:
Another mistake I often see is that over-motivated teams jump full on into building a PLG Model while being completely sales-led at the time. Following iterative steps will allow you to learn, while not hurting your conversion and ultimately build a better experience.

Have you ever thought about going Product-Led or do you just want to freshen up your and your teams knowledge?

Next Thursday, 7. April I'll give a free webinar where I explain the detailed steps to take. Feel free to join and bring your team as well. Link in the comment section.

Doing Outbound Emailing can be a very effective way to scale your business or create initial traction. However, doing this manually is way too costly and time consuming.

The next level would be to use tools that help you scrape data from platforms, find emails addresses and reach out to them. These can be very handy tools and depending on your needs even be the right thing.

But if you really want to scale, even these tools are too manual as the most costly factor in this entire process is YOU doing this manually.

This Thursday Lucas Maliczak is hosting an Ask-me-Anything Session where he will give a quick presentation and then discuss and answer any questions you have regarding the outbound topic.

urn:li:activity:6886969560176713728,"As a startup leader, how much time do you spend setting up Objectives and Key Results?

Its this time of the year again. Strategy, planning, Budgeting. Something that takes quite some time, but if done right is also super important.

One thing I often see missing and can recommend any startup is the proper implementation of Objectives and Key Results:

OKRs are a really good framework to translate your strategic planning into a clear operational plan for your teams and employees.

It makes your strategy tangible and empowers employees to easily understand how they can actively contribute to the overall goal. If done right, the positive impact is substantial:

Through owning clear metrics, employees and teams get more authority in their doing. This often leads to more motivation and also more efficiency, as you can be sure that every human just puts in more energy into reaching their goals, when they also are directly responsible for.

Gained motivation, authority, and efficiency makes your entire company a better oiled engine, and especially also having clear visibility of the mission and priorities of others, helps to find consensus and agreements faster when collaborating in projects.

This year, we start sharing valuable guides and templates such as in this case an OKR Template on our company channel RealGrowthHacking.

urn:li:activity:6884430856287506432,"The Mistakes and Habits that led us to success in 2021

2021 has been one of the most decisive years for me so far. I quit my great job at Beekeeper, started my own company and what began as a one-man show with no clear plan grew into a 3 person company by the end of the year, with revenue growing from 0 to 200k+ in the first 12 months since the idea was born.
And all of this somehow happened while living abroad in Egypt, Spain, and South Africa for 8 months.

Now, that all sounds like a smooth run, but of course, all of this was also associated with fears, problems and hiccups.

So I thought about sharing some of my learnings in the hopes that they might be of help to some of you:

<ü Be aware of what youre up for:
I started with RGH in January. I have already sold a program to 3 individuals and 5 startups started in February. I worked at Beekeeper until March and had to do everything at the same time. For over 3 months I worked like never before and was constantly afraid that I would not deliver the next week.
By the end of March, I had my own running business, but I was also completely burned out and had many of the signs associated with it. Was it worth it? Yes. Would I do it again the same way? Not sure.
But every individual should be aware of the initial intensity when doing the transition from employee to entrepreneur and maybe, taking some more time might not be a bad thing.

=ª<ü Bravery: One of the strongest emotions I felt this year was entrepreneurial fear. The existential fear. You don't see it coming and suddenly it hits you. Even if it's just psychological and maybe doesn't even reflect current reality, it shakes you to the bone.
But to be successful as an entrepreneur, there is no room for fear. Writing down the best- and worst-case scenarios helped me a lot. It gives you perspective and allowed me to get back into a fearless state.

< Our customers success is our success: That was our motto from the beginning and it is until today. And I really believe in it. There are so many benefits to running a quality business and making sure each and every customer is successful. I believe this is one of the best ways to grow a business sustainably. In our case, this resulted in an NPS score of 9/10 and a revenue contribution of 33% from our referral channel. But above all, it makes customers happy, and it makes us happy.

Now I could go on and share so much more, but this post is already too long. Hence, feel free to reach out to me if you want to hear more.

Id like to end with a huge thank you to all the people that actively supported RGH in 2021, without them it would never have been possible: Tim Eckert Lucas Maliczak Alberto Toledo Christoph Brenner Boris Manhart Andreas Slotosch Manuel Hartmann Sandro Meyer Luke Szkudlarek Simon G.

I love working with startups because every case is unique and challenges me on a personal level.

Nevertheless, there are still a lot of standard processes and frameworks that are just best practices to follow instead of creating

something custom that will confuse everyone and all your future employees. And one of those things I run over and over into is

implementing proper lifecycle stages. I see so many companies doing this wrong or not at all. And I'm not talking about newly founded 

business, but also well-established scaleups. Sadly, there is also a lot of information on the web which is just wrong.

But implementing this properly is crucial for your entire acquisition engine, for analysing and optimizing it.

Hence, I wanted to share with you a standard with detailed explanations about the stages, and what the conversion rates tell us from stage to stage (most important!)

Lifecycle stages can also differ depending on your GTM Strategy (freemium / free trial). We have also more data around this, if you have any questions or want to check our detailed mir board, reach out.

This week I had the pleasure to visit the office of beUnity . beUnity joined one of our programs early this year and did an awesome job applying the trained growth frameworks and created stunning results (i.e. +300% Inbound Growth in 3 months).

Equipped with beers and chips we went through their entire PLG process. Here some tipps if you want to go from sales-led to product-led:

– Calculate your contract values, start with your PLG approach for anything below 2k. Remain sales-led with the rest. Start, test, iterate, then open the funnel.

=ñStart with sales-assisted trials: In the beginning your product wont be ready to let users experience value by themselves. Give out trials but have the first experience with a sales person. Note down the questions, hick-ups, and aha-moments they have and you will know where to start with building your onboarding. Sales will always remain a key element also in a PLG strategy but you want to automate smaller deals and further qualify higher value deals before bringing in sales.

 Start early: Going PLG forces you to build a good product. Sales-led often does not, cause youre focusing on pleasing the buyer which is not always the actual user. The earlier you start the easier it will be as you have to refacture less of your UX.

We all know that today 9/10 Startups fail. But what I find super interesting is, that even out of the Scale-Ups 70% never return any money to investors. 70%!

What could be the difference...? What differentiates the successful from the unsuccessful Scale-Ups? Let me know if you have any ideas. I definitely do ;-)

Another sign of why it is absolutely vital for any business to focus on a North Star rather than revenue!=%

A north star is a metric that measures the value you offer your customers. While optimizing revenue will result in automatically

squeezing more money out of your customers in the short term, optimizing your North Star leads to providing more and more value in the long run.

This makes happier customers, less churn, more referrals, and ultimately, more revenue, in the long run =€

Now that I'm a huge fan of the North Star concept for software companies, I have great difficulty finding one for me in a company that sells knowledge, not software.

Each of us is an expert on something. But we are also active on a daily basis in areas in which we are not experts.

Learning by doing is a good thing, but both as a startup or a professional, making all the mistakes can be costly.

I was definitely the trial and error type, and it took me too long to realize the value of actually surrounding myself with mentors and experts to learn from.

At the same time, together with other growth leaders, we started to build up the growth hacking scene in Switzerland. As events grew, more questions came up, and I barely had enough time to support the many companies interested in these new and relatively untrained areas.

So I decided to take more time and founded realgrowthhacking.com to coach start-ups and scale-ups the concepts of growth hacking and product-led-growth.

urn:li:activity:6569552940745449472,"A clear statement by Sean Ellis - godfather of growth hacking - is, that already the implementation of growth structures within a traditionally organised company is a growth hack itself due to the loosening of very old silo boundaries resulting in change management challenges.

At Beekeeper we founded a 2 men growth team back in late 2017 which has grown to 7 people today. Its amazing to see how open the top management but also every single employee at Beekeeper is to let new ways of work happen and make big steps towards a new way of how former silo departments collaborate with each other.

Im proud to be part of that movement and of the entire evolvement Beekeeper has made since 2017.

To further boost our growth we have 1 key position left to fill: An open minded SOFTWARE ENGINEER with a backend focus and mindset to change things substantially. We count on your help to find the best fit for that role.

But hey, here's a hot take.

Partnerships might be one of the few areas where AI will have a hard time replacing  us, mere mortals.

The past few Covid-hit years thought us how to work effectively in a remote setting, but I always come back to a cliche which is: ""You can't replace a handshake on Zoom""

Sure, AIs can help streamline some tasks and processes, but they currently cannot replace the strategic, creative,  and interpersonal skills you rely on in your day-to-day partnership roles.

What's your take on this? Are you afraid of an AI taking your job? =1

urn:li:activity:6996510284932648960,"Plenty of tech partnerships are a waste of time and resources.

It's a sad reality, but that's the truth.

Here's how to avoid shipping an integration that no one will use:

- find a partner (product) category that strongly aligns with your own product's core capabilities

- develop a strong mutual use case with your chosen partner(s)

- map your accounts so you identify the potential userbase of your integration (=make sure there's a big enough market to serve, IPC fit & overlap)

- do customer interviews before building anything (=find out if it's actually useful for your customers)

- get internal insights from other GTM functions (sales, CS)

- try to make sure that the partner will equally invest in your go-to-market strategy 

This latter one's usually the tricky part because when you're starting a new partnership, partners sometimes tend to be overly optimistic/enthusiastic and overpromise/underdeliver. I've been guilty of this many times as well.

Hope this helps you launch something that will actually change the life of your customers for the better.

In the earlier days of the channel, partners had to earn the right and privilege to sell vendors' products.

Today, the power is in the partner's hands. 

Vendors have to earn partners' attention. Gone are the days when vendors could dictate what products to sell and when. 

That's why it's more important than ever to focus on not just enabling the partners but engaging  them in a way they prefer.

As we've found during our research, the vast majority of them never deployed their apps to alternative app stores. Why? Because it's manual labour, and it's cumbersome.

However, if they consider deploying elsewhere, not just the App Store and Google Play, they could rack up tens of thousands of installs while entering a new market overnight, with literally less than 30 minutes of work.

In case you're looking to grow your app and learn about alternative app store deployment, grab a seat below. =G

So what's so addictive about social media? >A >A >A  

It's the news feed. Be it Facebook, Twitter, or Linkedin (those are the ones I regularly used), the endless stream of content is what keeps you coming back.

There are upsides to using these platforms, so here's an amazing way to get the good side, while still keeping your sanity and productivity.

Block the news feed.

To do so, I use a browser extension called News Feed Eradicator. It allows you to use the platform, check DMs, search, etc., but it'll eradicate your algorithmically perfected, interesting -  but distracting - news feed by replacing it with inspiring quotes. 

Ever since I started using it, I use social media more purposefully. I can keep in touch with friends and family, but I removed the most addicting part of it.

I didn't know much about building integrations with tech partners, even less about driving real revenue through the channel.

What made me stick to it was the ability to govern the product to some extent. 

As digital workers, we don't really produce physical stuff that's concrete and tangible. That's something I'd like to get into later, like woodworking or constructing something.

But with building tech integrations, I could influence how a product is built, and if you build something truly useful for your customers, that'll stick around for long. 

You can leave your mark like that and influence your customers' lives for the better.

Do you also get the feeling sometimes that it'd be great to actually build something that's not digital?

You drink the same coffee, at the same time, work out, and then you get hungry more or less at the same time every day.

Research shows that those who regularly step outside of their comfort zones are more emotionally resilient and creative.

A few weeks ago, I started something I haven't done before: performing live webinars with Recart. I have to admit, it's been scary at first, as it should be. 

At first, I made tons of notes and prepared 100% for every scenario. Last week, I just made a few bullet points and it was good to go!

As you become more successful, your goals grow too. The more you challenge yourself with new experiences, the greater your comfort zone becomes, meaning what was once scary, becomes your new norm.

This week, I won't host our webinar, but present at it, discovering top Messenger marketing tactics leading Shopify Plus brands use to generate millions of dollars of revenue with Recart.

Couldn't be more excited about it!

After taking a hit in the stomach, the ecommerce industry will probably flourish again.

With the #coronavirus keeping people indoors and many brick-and-mortar stores forced to close, millions are turning to online delivery for basic items like toilet paper.

It hasn't been the smoothest ride. Inventory has been running low, and some deliveries are taking longer than expected.

But eventually, ecommerce is a space where you can invest now.

We're running a virtual event, so you can keep up your social distancing and still learn. Like, a lot.

Many other large B2B events are pulling the trigger. It's a huge decision, but It's the right thing to do.

But are we at the point already where such an event can be replaced and run 100% virtually?

I tend to think that events are not entirely great because of the keynotes and the content itself, but because it possesses phenomenal networking opportunities. That's hard to replace via Zoom.

A few takeaways from the episode:
- Brands will go where their customers are. Currently, it's Facebook Messenger. Chat apps have surpassed traditional social media apps.
- Facebook ad CPCs are increasing by 40-50% YoY. If you don't work on diversifying your marketing efforts, you'll go out of business soon.
- Number 1 headache of ecommerce is cart abandonment: 78% of all carts are never purchased. Reminders in Messenger are the most effective way to drive back the almost-buyers and convert them to recurring customers.

Balancing&
’ As lean a sales stack as possible (as few tools as possible)
’ Capabilities (data points, enrichment options + AI integrations)
’ Ease of implementation (build it today)
’ &and that automate as many steps as possible

Start with:

Apollo
³ + Clay
³ + Smartlead by Vaibhav

1ã Apollo.io does the initial list building (company size, industries, job titles, geo).
2ã Clay enriches with more data sources, finds emails and effortlessly lets you leverage AI to personalize your outreach.
3ã Still within Clay, you can automatically push your contacts to Smartlead.
4ã Smartlead handles [1] automating your outreach messages and [2] warming up your email addresses.

Then once you want to save $$$ on this workflow, you
’ get Datagma (by Raphael Azot) and one-click connect it to Clays through the API
’ get DeBounce and one-click connect it to Clays through the API

This way, you dont spend Clay credits for finding or verifying emails&
But youre still doing it inside the tool - which saves lots of (precious!) time.

Finally, youll want to manage all these leads.

Bardeen: Create powerful automated workflows without needing to know how to code. Pick pre-built automation to save time and find inspiration on tasks that can be automated.

Ocean.io: Build prospects lists using their lookalike prospecting feature. Input your ideal customer and let the algorithm finds the most similar companies.

Amplemarket: All-in-one prospecting solution that leverages AI for data enrichment, personalised messaging and smart actions (e.g: categorising out-of-meeting replies and automatically adapting the workflow)

Ubique: Record yourself once and dynamically create 1000s of personalised videos based on variables such as first name, company, location, job titles or any personalisation you can think of (also they make you read the script from BBC Planets Earth II to train their machine learning with your voice =).

1. Run all your unfound emails in BetterContact (by Frédéric Bonnand). 

The tool aggregates 10+ different data sources to enrich your prospect file. This will significantly improve your email finding rate.


2. Run all your catch-all (= unverifiable email addresses) in Scrubby (by Nick Abraham). 

Scrubby is the only software (I know of) that has a workflow to validate catch-all email addresses. They should be able to validate around ~60 to 70% of your list.

Ive noticed lots of entrepreneurs rely on referrals only.

But getting referrals isnt simple& when youre just starting out.

Ive found organic content + cold prospecting to be a great starting combination.

 1. You send messages to cold prospects.
 2. They wonder who you are - and check your socials/website.
 3. Your content showcases your expertise.

Overtime interesting events happen:
=I More people are organically shown your content.
=I Prospects you reach out to let you know theyve already seen you in their feed =@

As a result - you get more both outbound & inbound leads&

I bet not that many.

If you ever sent personalized videos to prospects& you noticed they draw more attention.

But sending personalized videos takes time.

So imagine recording a video once.

Then having AI dynamically change a few elements.

Which then creates hundreds of personalized videos.

Every prospect feels like you took the time to record a video for them individually.

And youre able to send videos at scale in no time.

Well - this technology already exists.

Tools such as Ubique allow you to do that.

And the output DOES make the videos feel personalized.

I came up with the below list =G

Heres what I believe make some of these tools different:

’ Instant Data Scraper: Completely Free Data Scraping extension. Super intuitive & easy-to-use. Typically, youd click on the extension, and their AI already knows what to extract and format it correctly.

’ LaGrowthMachine: The omniest of omnichannel outreach solutions. Im yet to find another software that lets you automate your outreach on LinkedIn, by Email AND on Twitter. They also have built-in data enrichment, so it still works with ""imperfect"" contact lists.

’ BetterContact: Simple concept but a great idea: enrich your data using several sources. Youre not sure which email finder to use? You can now leverage several at the same time.

’ Smartlead: One of few Sales Engagement platforms that lets you have unlimited email profiles. Everyone serious about deliverability knows that scaling sending volume involves creating new inboxes & domains. Most platforms charge on a pay-per-profile basis. Using a solution such as Smartlead saves you lots of $$$.

’ Ocean.io: Only B2B Database that leverages Lookalikes Search. For those who used Facebook Ads in the golden days, you know that the LaL %age audience was skyrocketing =€ ROAS. 

In many cases, the lowest-hanging fruit for a new outbound campaign is to find companies similar to existing clients for whom youve had great results. No tool makes identifying these companies easier.


Want to hear from you people... whats a prospecting tool you know that does it differently?

Everybody tells you to create new domains, but nobody explains how =G

Heres how I set it up in my own prospecting:
’ I use Google to buy new domains.
’ I forward these new domains to my main domain.
’ I create an inbox on top of each new domain.

So, for example if my main domain is coldiq.com, I create:
- coldiq.co
 -coldiq.io
 -coldiq.net

Which all redirect to coldiq.com (they actually do, try it =@).

And each has an email inbox like so =G
- michel@coldiq.co
- michel@coldiq.io
- michel@coldiq.net

I limit my sending to 50 emails per inbox per day. Thus, if I want to send 1000 emails per day at high deliverability rates, I need 20 domains.

How do you guys scale your sending volume?
