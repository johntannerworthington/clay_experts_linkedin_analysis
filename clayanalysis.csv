When we run outbound campaigns for Clay or some other outbound marketing tools we work with, sourcing a dedicated list so you don't have to pay for the enrichment of profiles of people that mention things like 

outbound

urn:li:activity:7335296636778135553,"One of our customers has case studies with companies like Tesla, Nestle, Walmart, Cargill and so many more. This is how we mention the right case study in every email. 

A commonly accepted practice in cold email is to include some social proof of how you helped a company in the past. 

A lot of case studies fall flat because the prospect has never heard of your case study or if they have heard of them, it's completely irrelevant to what they do. 

This customer has over 10,000 past customers that they said we could name drop. This is how we organized the list so we would mention the right company in each email to prospects. 

1. We needed to first enrich the list so we had as much data to choose from as we could. Industry, associated members on linkedin, employee headcount bands, HQ location etc. 

We of course used Clay to get this done

2. Then I uploaded the list to chatgpt o3 and said something to the effect of ""remove any industries that are duplicates besides the companies with the most amount of employees in each headcount band. 

Fun Fact about linkedin data - most data providers give you the employee headcount based on the associated member count. Meaning the amount of employees that say they work at the company. 

Depending on your industry, this number can be very far off. For SaaS companies, it's probably good. But for manufacturing companies, it's not useful at all. 

So I had o3 find one example company in each band of employee ranges on linkedin, in each industry, and then only give me the one with the most amount of associated employees so we had a proxy to hopefully get the most recognizable company in that headcount range in the industry.

3. From there, we had everything we needed to do a simple lookup in Clay. 

Use lookup multiple rows from other table to find the case studies in the industry and then filter that for size so you can name drop the perfect company case study. 

At this scale, we didn't have stories to go with each but if your list is smaller you could add custom case study stories as well!

Alexander Han from Overjoy (who LinkedIn isn't letting me tag) showed me that he likes to do this with a smaller list of companies with gemini flash since it's not cost prohibitive but gemini flash outperformed 4o mini on the needle in the haystack AI challenge and I thought it would be worth mentioning if you want this to be done faster.

urn:li:activity:7333491520836165632,"So great to record content recently with some great agency leaders. Here's what I learned from each of them. 

Enzo Carasso >ò was so generous in sharing how he thinks about cold email copywriting and how sharing a case study is ok, but sharing a lead magnet tied to it is better. 

He uses a lot of copy that creates a lead magnet out of the knowledge his customer's inherently have without having to make something new. 

Think about it, there's some information every business has that their customers would love to know. Instead of just sharing a case study, he helps his customer's break their process into a framework that can entice the sales call from a cold email. 

I feel that Enzo is really successful because of his creativity. 

Alex Fine<2 and Ali (not pictured and LinkedIn isn't letting me tag) taught me a lot about the outbound campaigns they are running that get a boost from their LinkedIn ads. Alex and I were the only ones that showed up to the impromptu gym session and we had a great workout talking about life and business. 

Alex and Ali are successful from my perspective because of the great partnership they have fostered with each other and they bring their life time of experience to their agency. Almost as if everything they went through is culminating into Understory right now. 

Alex Vacca >à=à and Michel Lieben >à (and Dan Rosenthal / Fivos Aresti not pictured) My hat really tips to this team. Recruiting, courses, content ANIMALS, affiliate deals, and more. Chatting with their team was eye opening to see how much they are doing and how they decentralize their team to get it done. 

Alex and Michel are truly forces to reckon with and have done a great job building their team and removing themselves as bottlenecks in their business. Which is how they can keep posting new ARR numbers what feels like every week on LinkedIn. 

If they were to drop an agency building course, I'd check it out. 

Patrick Spychalski the agency owner I spend the most time with made me see why they are getting more and more out of outbound and into Clay implementation. (we are doubling down on sending more emails but I see where he is coming from). But man, they have some sick linkedin automation campaigns that make me think we might be missing out on some of that!

Buy regular google and outlook inboxes
double verify your leads

The biggest mistake I see when people are making lead magnets is that they are giving away great value but have no way to book a call. 

One person I was speaking to was selling physical products and asking for replies to send them the free product. 

Everyone wanted free product but wouldn't get on a call.

A quick change to something like ""I can show you how our process works on a call by sending you a free box as the demo"" and they started booking more meetings just with that CTA change. 

Another is we are working with a consulting service for marketing agencies (that I highly recommend. We pay them for their services and they pay us for leads). 

We would get a ton of responses when we said we had a resource to help agency owners fix their pricing or help them but they wouldn't book calls.

Meeting bookings went up by 3x literally by us just saying that we would show them on the call and how it applies to your business.

This is what I learned from it. 

1) When you know your target audience, you can bend the rules on ""best practices"". Like I said before, this email is 623 words. It's so long, I really didn't want to even send it.

urn:li:activity:7330230825872982016,"Here's a playbook we ran to take cold leads and get them into a newsletter which ultimately turned them into inbound leads for us. 

One use case for cold email I don't see enough people talking about is to use it to do things other than book meetings. 

Some offers are actually better served with using cold email to get people into your orbit rather than booking meetings. 

I know that's true because of cold emails we have sent for ourselves. If I send a cold email and have a good sales conversation with someone, the deal still takes more calls than an inbound lead despite all of our proof etc. 

Of course it's because they haven't been following along like an inbound lead has. So naturally, they need more information to make a decision. 

I wanted to think about what we could do to get people to see my content before ever booking a call with me. 

So I thought about what do people find useful that I can repeatedly give away for free. 

The most common sales trigger people ask us to take action on (which is a great idea for almost anyone) is to target people who are new in their role. 

So I would pull everyone that is new in their role in the United States with a director level title or above and put them into a google sheet so I can send an email like

Hey {{first_name}} -- do you have a way to track {{AI generation of customer titles they sell to}} and when they have joined a new company. 

Here's a google sheet with every director level title and above person that joined a company in the last 60 days with company headcount and industry filters so you can do your own filtering. 

Just request access so I know you got it. 

{{link}}

Then when people request access (and a lot of people do) we give access and say ""Hey we actually send this as a newsletter every Monday, can I give you this list every week?""

Then when they say yes we add them to beehiiv. 

In the newsletter I send the list and a YouTube video so that they can start getting familiar with our content.

Now keep in mind, the best AI strategy for your outbound campaigns comes from taking the workflow you would do manually if you were reaching out to a company and automating it. 

These are common data points our customers ask us for when targeting local business owners. 

1) Their online reviews. We pull most of these with Serper, specifically their google reviews. 

You can use this as a boring first line or you can mine the google reviews for more information. 

This is one of the few times that we are switching from usually using 4o mini and using gemini flash 2.0 instead. A customer showed us that it passes ""the needle in the haystick"" test better and now we use it to parse reviews for keywords or insights we are looking for. 

2) Their customer stories on the site that give more insights than just reviews. This we get with Claygent. I can tell you all love this because I've been getting far more emails mentioning the case studies on my website than I ever have before. 

3) Pricing if it's listed. This can give some ideas if they have multiple packages or if they are a low cost provider vs a premium provider. 

4) Support phone numbers if listed. 

5) We use an mx lookup tool to find how old the website is and when it was registered as well if we have someone that wants to find companies that just started or are much older. 

6) Competitors in the area. We use Apify and Serper to get this by just doing a google maps search and excluding the prospective company from our output.

urn:li:activity:7328048958579130368,"The final use for open tracking that I feel like people don't talk about enough and it helps us so much. Estimating inbox delivery health. 

For many reasons, tracking opens for your outbound campaigns is not a best practice. 

1) it's not reliable. Since Apple made an update years ago, any email that is received triggers the open tracking pixel. 

2) only marketers track opens so it's considered a spam flag. 

For most people that are questioning if email deliverability is the reason they aren't getting responses, turning on open tracking for a day or two is one of the easiest ways to get a clear answer.

You really can only run analysis on what bounces you're getting, what's your overall reply rate, open tracking, inbox reputation on your warming platform, and inbox placement tests. 

These are all good metrics but can take either some time to really track or are just estimates. 

Someone commented on my last post that they have an automation to see if out of office emails drop off and they consider that their placement tests. Hard to recommend everyone goes and builds that system. 

Of course open tracking is an estimate but if you are landing in spam, you'll see those inboxes have 10 or 15% open rates while your healthy inboxes will have something like 40-60%+ open rates.

We had two problems with our internal waterfall before. We had no confirmation via live LinkedIn data that the person still works at the company we think they do. We had to just trust the other data sources. 

And also, if we ran out of credits with some of our providers (who should really do auto-billing) we would have a single point of failure. Now there are redundancies that we will still be running no matter what. 

I don't trust any data provider as much as either Claygent to do a live linkedin profile lookup or to use the internal data the Clay team has put together. If Clay wasn't around tomorrow, Wiza's data is amazing and where I would go. This just works for us. 

Now we have formulas to do a live lookup and confirm that the person works where we think that they work. 

THEN we also added a lookup into HubSpot to see, ""ok they still work at the same place, have we ever found their email before and when was it last validated?""

If it's in our hubspot and validated 90 days ago, we don't run the email waterfall again and just output the email we found in the past.

Prospeo.io
Then Icypeas
Then LeadMagic (not pictured I know)

If the domain is validated as catchall but any of the providers we don't continue to run the verification at all. 

Then whatever is found, we use Instantly.ai's email verification. I just love that their verification has the cached sending component in it. 

If we run out of credits because I need to manually top it up (¡Felipe Aranguiz feature request here haha) then we use DeBounce who also needs to have someone build autobilling as well.

We are now tracking all of these metrics on behalf of GEX customers. 

1. Positive replies delivered in the last 30 days
2. Positive replies delived in the last 3 days. If it drops below target, we get alerts to make tweaks or discuss with our customer new ideas.
3. Emails sent yesterday in total
4. Unique emails sent yesterday. If we don't hit the goal, alerts and tasks get assigned to the team
5. Inbox rotation based on reputation. If any inboxes in a campaign drop below perfect reputaton, we rotate them out every 24 hours. 
6. Time from campaign set up to campaign launch so we make sure we are hitting our SLAs
7. Bounce rates so we can jump on large swings in bounces immediately. 
8. Leads not contacted goal for the week. Every Friday we add more leads to the campaigns so that on Monday all successful campaigns are loaded with enough leads to get through the week.
9. Reply rate of a campaign dropping below 1% triggers a task to manually review the inboxes 
10. We have a count of every inbox we have for a customer at 100% reputation AND what's in campaigns vs. never been used so we can always keep back up inboxes for all customers for WHEN something goes wrong. 

We are probably tracking even more than this but I thought it would help give some insights on what we are tracking across all of our customers. 

The 3 core issues we are always looking out for which are the main drivers for not getting outbound leads are 

1. Is this just a bad campaign? do we need to pause and do something new? That's why we are watching for positive response goals in a 3 day window. We have to act fast. 

2. Are we sending enough new sequences? Email 1 is responsible for most of your positive replies. Focus on that.

They have an offer that was dangerously close to a type of offering we turn down every time and I told them they had to run a free test before they paid us to do anything because we haven't been successful in the past. 

I can't get into the specifics too much but the lesson always rings true. 

They asked us ""What should our AI strategy be here?"" 

And I said my normal response, ""What would you manually research about them for 10 minutes and how does that change your message?""

""We would research who their competitors are and the types of things people are searching for that lead to a high intent buyer"" 

Perfect.

With Claygent, finding this data is incredibly easy. Use the metaprompter in Clay or use chatgpt to make a prompt. Clay has been around long enough that o3 knows how to make a claygent prompt really well. 

We uploaded their target market which we used Ocean.io lookalikes to build (which just dropped a new update today you should check out) because other platforms don't do the segmentation very well. 

Then we ran the domains in Clay so we could name drop a competitor, keywords or research topics people lookup if they are likely to be interested, and then we launched the campaign 15 minutes after the call we had with them. 

Free tests have been really interesting to do because I think most companies can know very quickly if their outbound campaigns are working or not and don't need to spend 3 months paying an agency to figure it out. 

If you launch a campaign and don't immediately get responses, that's fine. But maybe hiring an agency to essentially regurgitate what you tell them on your onboarding call might not be the best use of funds.

By now, you might have known that Clay has a waterfall feature for finding emails and a ton of other things. 

The reason we don't use the whole waterfall is because we don't have accounts with all of the providers and I like to use API keys directly. 

We also control for never sending emails to catch all emails unless verified by 2 of our providers as valid catch all which you have to build the waterfall yourself on. 

These are the providers we use in order and why. 

TryKitt.ai is number one. Erol Toker is doing two things very interestingly. 1. He's keeping costs low and letting customer word of mouth market his company. 2. He has a serious amount of knowledge about email verification and deliverability. Talking with him is always great to get a more scientific approach to spam filters. The value we get with Trykitt puts them number 1 for us. 

Prospeo.io our OG love. I did a data test and they performed the best when we took positive responses and tried to find emails given the Name and Domain. We knew the emails were valid because they were real leads. They performed the best. Only caveat is this test was 2 years ago and we are due for another one. 

LeadMagic is then next by the great Jesse Ouellette. 

Icypeas is last because in my testing, they have the strictest validation rules. 

All of these platforms have catch all validation baked in and this is where we build our own waterfall. I love being able to increase our lists by being able to send to catch alls but we only send to a catch all if 2 of our providers agree on the email being a valid catch all. If not, we throw it away. 

The final big unlock that has kept our bounce rate below 2% is a final validation with Instantly.ai's verification which has been an absolute game changer for us.

Most data providers change the way they show you the data by showing the relevant results first.

They type in CEO and see pages of CEOs in front of them. 

But little do they know that an Executive Assistant to the CEO is lurking around the corner on the last pages of the search. 

So when we are checking lists, before we upload them to campaigns, we always check the last pages and remove bad fits instead of only seeing the best work on the first few pages. 

Clay might be the only exception to the rule here because they dont filter by relevance but basically every other major data provider Ive used will do this and you can really clean your list by starting on the last pages and working from there.

ChatGPT Deep research has recently been very useful to help us build lists for customers. Either to scrape hard to scrape websites or to find niche industries. 

The first way we used it was to build a list of companies sponsoring an event this year and those that sponsored last year.

The event website was not very easy to scrape because all of the sponsors were shown as images and nothing else. We used deep research to pull it and it did a great job handling the images. 

It also had in its memory I suppose companies that had sponsored last year and we were able to separate them and include them in another list. 

Another use case came up where we needed to create very niche lists of businesses in the a media space. None of the usual culprits had a really great list of them but deep research did a really great job.

This customer really pushed us to increase our email deliverability checks and systems for all of our customers. 

Keep in mind, this is very atypical of most of the work we do for people. 

This customer sends a high volume campaign with a good offer but people either need it or they dont. And theres no signal to look at to prove that they need it or dont. 

So the campaign leans towards needing to send a good amount of emails every day. 

We ran tests with AI messaging and trying to segment the list better but nothing really moved the needle. 

We instead focused on making their email deliverability as clean as possible. 

We switched from Debounce to Instantly.ai for their email verification and lowered our bounce rates overnight. 

We built an automation to remove any inbox over 3% bounce from the campaigns.

We also used an internal API in smartlead to remove any inbox automatically that dropped below a 99% warmup reputation.

If you have been following me for a bit you know I dont like to exaggerate and try to be as transparent as possible but this one blew me away. 

We onboarded a client that said they had good success 2 years ago with cold email, had to take a break from the business, and is coming back. 

They knew email had changed a ton so they wanted to have an agency help get them up to speed which is why they came to us. 

They told us who to target and what to say because it was working for them in the past. 

We asked if they wanted us to make changes and they said to just run what they were doing since they did so much split testing. 

We launch the campaign and it flopped two days in a row. 

They said that if we couldnt revive it, the math wasnt going to work for them which I completely agreed with. 

So I just used one of our go to Claygent prompts to research what case studies and reviews the company we are reaching out to has listed on their website. 

This would change the subject line and relevantly tie the first line about their past work with our clients offer. 

Just that changed radically increased the positive response rates. 

I think mostly for 2 reasons

1. The first line is far more appealing when its mentioning researched work so we for sure were getting more opens.

2. This customer really does have a great offer and I think there were many people on the fence of responding but theres a feeling of reciprocity when you get an email that has better research in it than just I saw youve been the {{title}} for {{time}} years.

Website deanonymization softwares - Can you imagine telling someone 10 years ago that they could get a slack notification of someone visiting their site without filling in a form just because that person signed up for free WiFi at an airport one time? Wild. 

Good criticisms about the possibilities of data inaccuracies and such but as long as you are filtering the leads youre given for being in your ICP, its well worth it when the data is right and you reengage someone that didnt fully opt in. 

Claygent - Traditional databases feel limiting because they cant possibly give you the exact data that is only useful for your use case when they have a mountain of other things to work on. 

Having an AI agent that can find random things for you like how many locations a company has, what kind of CTA buttons does a website use, and other unstructured data points is truly so helpful. 

LinkedIn data providers - Freddie Mercury said fat bottomed girls make the world go round. My world goes round because of the brave fake profiles putting themselves in harms way to unlock this walled garden Im posting on. 

Instantly.ai  - truly broke the internet with their revolutionary pricing model and hats have to go out to them for it. Best email verification software Ive ever used. 

Apify - Gateway drug of scrapers. Just poke around for the data you want on there. Youd be shocked by what they have. Try to use the Apify supported scrapers when you can. No offense to dataXscraper69 but they dont respond to my support questions. 

ZenRows - Ability to scrape any website and turn it into JSON data and it comes with its own proxy network so you dont have to do that part. Say less

Serper - Google built the best scraper in the world. They just dont want you to have access to it programmatically. Serper breaks that for you.

No clue how they do it, I can make a connection for you if you're interested. 

Bharatt did a couple things to make this really sing.

1. He used Clay to find the most likely competitor or the company AND their estimated web traffic from similarweb

Pro tip: when you're looking for competitors, don't trust one data source. Pull as many as you can and ask AI which competitor comes up the most often from those data sources. 

2. He used Claygent to find a case study on the company website we were targeting so that we can mention them in our outreach as well in the P.S. line

That way we started with a great personalization in the beginning about the competitor of the company and their web traffic estimates. 

Then we finished with talking about how we can help them get more customers like their best case study.

3. Email was under 85 words and followed the basics most people on here talk about. Nothing fancy after that.

urn:li:activity:7311380603361214464,"A cold email expert I look up to for their operation prowess asked me for help with AI prompting and here were 3 mistakes they are making that I see all the time. 

The person I'm texting is someone I really look up to in the cold email space. Operationally, they run a great business. Inboxes, list building, hiring. They give me a lot of great advice. 

This new age of AI prompting has them confused and they reached out for help. They are making mistakes that I see over and over again when correcting people's AI workflows in Clay and elsewhere. 

1) Giving AI too many tasks to do per run. 

The cheap models can only handle one task at a time. In this person's Clay workflow, they were asking one prompt to create 4 different outputs. 

With the more expensive models, you can push the boundaries more. But for the cheapest models, only ask AI to do one thing at a time. 

Getting information about a website is one task.
Making a categorization request based on the website is another task. Don't mix the two. 

2) Using Claygent when you should really just be using regular AI (or vice versa). 

Claygent should be used when you need to get live data from the site that you can't pull in other ways. 

What case studies are listed on the page?
What's their pricing?
What support documentation do they have? 

Don't use Claygent to look at a blurb of text and make a categorization decision or use it to write a sentence for an email. Use a regular AI input for that. 

3) 0 use of examples 

I think using examples is the biggest ROI for getting your output right. 

You might not have the most amazing prompt but if you give the AI good examples, the outputs look great. 

Be sure to try to give examples for different situations. This person is trying to categorize local businesses. I would make sure to give AI an example when there's a lot of text on the site and it has a lot of data to make a decision on.

Make sure to also give an example of a website with little to no data.

I'd also make sure to find a website that definitely isn't a fit and train the AI on what to do when it isn't a fit as well. 

4) Using System Prompts

AI is like a 5th grader with infinite knowledge. Using the system prompt to tell the AI that it's going to sell tacos vs. selling artisanal tacos made with chicken, beef, and pork as the main meat and classical mexican toppings out of a food truck is much more precise.

Using system prompts to make sure the AI knows how to make decisions and what it's role is supposed to be can really help.

On top of this, I use a voice dictation software so that it doesn't feel like you're endlessly typing and can really give the detail you need in the prompt without losing your mind.

To become an Eagle Scout, you have to do a project in benefit of your community. 

Mine was to repair the walls of my church, clean up the overgrown vegetation, raise money to get all of this done, and add more landscaping for free to the church. 

Eagle Scout projects are often this short sprints of lots of work, lots of sweat and you ultimately give back to your community. 

To their credit, Girl Scout Gold Award Projects are much tougher. They have to do a project as well for the community with a key difference. 

The project can't be a sprint. The project technically shouldn't end. It has to live on without your involvement in the community. 

So say a Girl Scout helps their school do a food drive. They have to be able to turn over the keys and the contacts that everything is in place for the food drive to run without the Girl Scout to push it forward. 

Might seem silly, but internally, we often think about things as Eagle Scout Projects or Gold Award Projects.

When we launch outbound campaigns for our customers, we always are looking for the holy grail of data scraping in outbound.

Relevance. 

We are trying to take the same workflow a rep or a founder would do if they were to research a company for 10 minutes. 

What are they looking for and how does that change their messaging? 

Here are some that we tried that didn't work for us so you don't have to test them. 

1. We tried following up sending people web traffic data we scraped from similar web and we would say something like ""looks like you get about 250k site visitors per month.""

Always show your work with outbound. Similar web is an estimate and we got many people coming back and saying it was totally wrong. 

Change this to ""Similar web told me you get about 250k site visitors

2. We would email people about their employee headcount growth

""Looks like the team has grown by 18.17%!""

Dumb dumb dumb. Looking back on it, we broke our own rule. No human would ever say that. No one has the math on that. It's a great signal but a terrible way to approach it in a cold email. 

Change to something like ""Looks like the team is growing. I saw {{employee 1 and 2}} recently announced they joined the team on LinkedIn. 

Clay of course makes this super easy to automate. 

3. Using someone's college in a follow up email. 

Not relevance I know, but still a fail. 

We thought it would be a good idea to follow up with something like ""Hey, I figured you didn't go to {{School}} to worry about {{annoying problem}}.

The people that went to Stanford, LOVED this and we got a lot of responses. 

The state school folks....not so much. 

We shut that down in a day. 

4. Using AI to make a company analogy

Relevance fakery and it didn't work anyway. 

P.S. the same way you help people save money on their taxes, we help people save money on their outbound campaigns. 

Usually if you nail an AI line, people will comment on it and say thank you for sending a personal email. No one has ever said that on these and we just don't do it anymore.

Brandon Charleson and I are participating and while I know you expect me to be posting about outbound and automations, fitness is a big part of my life. 

If you dont like personal posts on LinkedIn keep scrolling. 

If you need someone to shoot ideas about how you can get started or improve your fitness journey, here are things that helped me. 

1. Workout for at least 15 minutes per day. Research shows you can increase strength with even just one hard set a week. Or even walking every day for 15 minutes is extremely helpful for your body. 

It doesnt take a lot of time make a big impact. 

2. Dont compare yourself to others and where they are. The goal of working out isnt to do more than someone else, its to keep working out. 

If you ran a sprint with 100% effort and so does Usain Bolt, hed be far faster but both of you would have tried 100%. 

3. If you buy home equipment, store it so its right in front of you and never ever ever store things on it or turn it into a hangar. 

My wife knows the gym in our garage takes up half the garage and nothing but gym equipment can be on the gym mats. 

I also have a pull up bar in my office and never hang coats on it or anything. (Think of how many friends have a treadmill with tons of boxes on it)

Thinking that youll have to pull out and set up your equipment or clean it up to get started is going to just add friction.

Heres how you can do it automatically and lower the chances of your screwing up and messing up your messaging. 

In the video below, Alex told us that one of his favorite messages was to mention a competitor in his cold call scripts and emails. 

Deploying this at scale is risky business because naming a competitor gets tough based on the prospects opinion. 

The three main buckets to plan for when naming competitors at scale are companies with good LinkedIn presence (like SaaS), e-commerce, and local businesses.

For companies that are well documented on LinkedIn, we use Serper to pull a google search of who G2, Crunchbase, Zoominfo and Owler says the competitors are by automating a google search like 

{{company name}} competitors {{country}}. 

Then we use AI to figure out which company was named the most often and will use that in our scaled outbound campaigns. 

For e-commerce companies, we will pull the data from Similarweb and Spyfu and say something more like I see {{competitor}} is buying similar keywords or ranking for similar organic keywords. 

For local businesses, this is maybe the easiest. We just automate a google places search and exclude the domain we are emailing. Then we also filter out the results with over 100 google reviews so we dont name a big box brand and then just name someone with less than 100 or so google reviews and a great rating in their area. 

Check out the video below to see what Im talking about and I hope this helps you automate name dropping a competitor or updating your CRM so your team can do this manually when planning accounts.

To which I always respond, who cares what I think of it, the positive response rate is the only thing that matters and what you have here could easily outperform anything I suggest because you know your customers so well. 

But one thing that we have tested time and time again and it always loses is ending your email with something like.

Let me know if youd like to chat by booking a time here

And hyperlinking your calendar. 

We are seeing more success booking meetings with something like, 

If helping with {{problem or quantifiable result}} would be useful, lets find a time to connect? 

And then sending an email as fast as possible with BOTH a calendar link and two manual options to meet is the best response.

The creative ideas campaign is a campaign I thought of almost 2 years ago that uses AI to send 3 ideas of how a prospect could leverage your product or service in their business. 

We train the AI on what your company does and then manually create 5 examples of ideas for companies on the list. When its done, we have great suggestions of how each company can take advantage of the product or service customized to each cold email we are sending. 

This is the winning campaign for startups like Clay and Instantly. 

Then a publicly traded company started working with us and we deployed it on some of their colder inbound leads and it crushed. 

(Even unseating another services firm from the project entirely.)

If you want to find ways to increase your inbound conversions on some colder deals, I would suggest checking out the video below and applying it to your colder inbound leads.

urn:li:activity:7302783654718562306,"This is the framework I teach my team internally to prompt AI and Claygent. I think it can help you add structure to your prompting. 

I find prompting AI is a mix of giving the correct prompt and good enough examples. 

You have to keep in mind that its like speaking to an 8th grader with infinite knowledge. You might think youre giving good enough instructions but you need to be so much more explicit than you think. 

Here are the steps I teach the team. 

1) start with telling AI the overall output and task you want it to accomplish. a simple 1-3 sentences is all you need here.

2) Give the AI the data and text you want it to reference. Never ever just say something like tell me what customers Hubspot.com sells to Always get text from the website and dont expect AI to already know anything. 

3) Add a ton of text to constrain how crazy the AI might get. Tell it to keep the output under a certain amount of words, output at a 5th grader reading level, and other things to cover any edge cases of what AI thinks it should be doing but shouldnt. This is where you teach it how you would do this if you were to do it manually. 

4) Give AI examples to work off of that you manually write. For easy things like cleaning company names, you might need just 1 or 2 examples. For complex things, like suggesting how a company might be able to take advantage of a product or service, we might give it up to 5 examples. 

Outside of these steps we also try to just ask AI to do one thing at a time. Many things go wrong because you ask AI to do too many things at a time. 

One prompt for one task. Dont expect it to do something like research AND output a sentence ready for a cold email. Chain two AIs at minimum to do something like look up pricing of a company and then say something about it.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7302783654718562306,,3 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,1.0,,,,,True,Yes,No,No
urn:li:activity:7302696848262139904,"Two things to try if you arent getting many responses from your outbound campaigns I like to call chunking up and chunking down. 


Did I invent these terms, of course not. But its a framework I like to use when an initial campaign doesnt work. 

When you start a campaign, most people use what I call Down the middle messaging.

Looks like, we help {{types of customers}} accomplish {{goal}} in {{time}} without {{risk}}. 

There are times when this wont work on outbound for whatever reason. Market saturation, bad timing, disbelief, etc. 

So the next thing we will do I call chunking up and down. 

When we chunk up, we take the how out of the equation. 

Take staffing and recruiting for home service businesses. We wrote multiple campaigns for someone and the best campaign didnt actually talk about recruiting at all. 

It only talked about the past customers of this company and how much more money they were making because of the additional staff. 

The second best campaign happened to be the chunking down version for this exact same customer. 

When you chunk down, you talk about the individual features of your product or service that people would find interesting. 

Telling prospects in a different campaign that the way our customer did the recruiting was with Facebook ads so they could steal techs from companies that normally wouldnt be thinking about leaving was the second best performing campaign. 

So if your normal messaging isnt working try both sides of the spectrum. Dont talk about how you specifically do something and just talk about the outcomes.

Often times, customers will ask if we can filter by companies that offer a more premium services (assuming the premium price tag can help them afford our customer's service).

For software, you can normally get away with just using something like Claygent to find the pricing page and the prices listed. You can even find if they have enterprise pricing listed. 

For ecommerce, it gets a bit tougher. Claygent (or any other AI agent ) isn't great for this task because it often finds 1 or 2 products and then infers from there. 

For these companies, I like to scrape the google shopping page with Serper to get as many examples of products and prices as I can and we determine the average order value using AI on these results.

These can usually be done in most B2B prospecting platforms and I'll share the sources we use if it isn't easily done in a popular one. 

1. Targeting people that recently started new roles. 

This is an oldie but a goodie. Unlike recent fundraise rounds, this still has life to it for sure. 

We personally use Clay for this but most B2B prospecting platforms can handle this. 

2. Name someone else in the department. 

This works really well when you are targeting larger mid market or enterprise companies where you know the job titles but it's hard to pin down exactly who is responsible for something. 

Might look like 

""Let me know if this is better suited to talk to {{other employee name}} given their role"". 

Often we will get responses of people saying we are right or they'll point us to the actual person. 

Great for follow ups in SMB as well. 

3. Targeting keywords in open jobs

I'm less bullish on targeting companies by just having open jobs for a position than I used to be but reaching out to companies because of keywords in their job openings has been working even better. 

4. Technology filtering

Competitor switching, integration messaging, or just knowing if they use something expensive they'll have budget for you too. Those are our top 3 ways we use technology filters for outbound. 

5. Past experience at Case Studies

Clay past experience filter makes this so much easier. We target people that used to work at a company's past customers and now have a role at a different company in a correct ICP. 

6. Target your competitor traffic

Can be done with...

Trigify.io to find linkedin engagement
ScrapeLi to target followers of a company page
or 
AimLogic to target people searching for your competitors. Works for running ads and not outbound but thought I'd mention.

urn:li:activity:7299797731974303747,"Here are 6 ways we are using Claygent to increase responses with AI even industry professionals aren't sure if it's manually done or with AI. 

I'm going to start this one off with reminding you that the best AI strategy for your outbound emails can't be stolen from anyone's LinkedIn post.

They are found by asking yourself what would you send if you had 10 minutes to research a prospect and how would the research change your message. 

When we do that for customers, we often will use these in follow ups so even though it isn't as relevant, we still have well researched messaging. 

1. Case Study Callout

Using AI to scan the website and call out a case study they have listed. Can be a great p.s. line for just kudos, a first line, or tie into your offer with relevance. 

""saw you work with Intercom. When you close enterprise deals like them, do you have issues filling out the company's enterprise questionnaire quickly?"" 

Could be a fun one for a company like Workstreet cc: Ben Levy

2. Call out their competitor

Use AI to get multiple competitor datapoints and find the one that pops up the most often. Blindly trusting one data source is how you accidentally send an incorrect competitor. We will have AI check the competitor's listed from Crunchbase, Zoominfo, SimilarWeb, G2, and Owler and then whichever comes up the most often we name in the email. 

This is working very well right now for Trigify.io

3. Name a product from the website

Great for targeting ecommerce. First lines, personalizations, but also relevance can be picked up here. 

""Hey {{first_name}} -- when someone orders a {{product name}} and they claim it didn't arrive, how do you know who to trust?""

We use this a lot but see how it can be applied for Deliverlitics?

4. Call out reviews from Google / Yelp / Trustpilot / G2

You technically don't even need an AI agent for this. Serper, Apify, DataForSEO all your friends here. 

Again, great for ps. lines and first lines. Or if you're in reputation management you could say 

""Hey I saw that negative review Diane left about {{ai summary of what it was about}}.

Would you want us to remove that on a performance only basis.""

This verifiably crushes. I've posted about it in the past. 

BrandYourself could use this if they aren't already. 

5. Name pricing and features. 

I posted this last week about how we did it for Nate Zaru. 

We talked about using product videos to help people understand why they should upgrade from one feature tier to the next. Calling out specifically a feature and the pricing plan cost per month. 

6. Follow up with a notification of an ICP company hiring a new ICP title. 

Fun one we just started experimenting with and will share results when we have them. My plan is to add some value to every follow up we send and get them to read our first email again.

urn:li:activity:7298727570873745409,"Had a conversation with Jordan Crawford on personalization vs. relevance that I thought I'd share. 

There seems to be a war on personalization that is mostly justified. 

For context, I consider personalization when you add custom variables to your email campaigns that have nothing to do with the problem you solve or research relevant to your outreach. 

Relevance is when you've used the custom variables to show you've done your research and are connecting that research with a problem you can solve. 

I see people dumping on using AI in cold emails in ways that have nothing to do with your offer, which again is mostly justified. 

But to say it should NEVER be used it too much of a blanket statement. 

Is reaching out with relevance better, unequivocally yes. But if you don't have something relevant to reach out with, you should still run a test to see if personalization would do better. 

In this exchange the restaurant thing Jordan was talking about was 3 years ago I was adding it to a bunch of our campaigns to call out a local restaurant in the p.s. line. 

Now we only use this with local business owners and only when we found emails that aren't listed in major databases. 

When you do that, we see the restaurant line increases positive response by 3x.  

Most of the personalization arguments are justified but keep in mind that the math is the math and if it increases positive responses which increases meeting booked which increases opportunities created which increases revenue then don't listen to the gurus. 

Even me, what do I know about your offer and the way you individually have to do outbound. 

Final disclaimer, this is also after you have refined your real message as your offer, the audience your prospecting to, and the way you convey that message matters above relevance or personalization or even using AI at all in emails. 

Communicating your offer effectively is more important than anything.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7298727570873745409,,3 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,13.0,,,,True,No,No,No

urn:li:activity:7292289502239162368,"By far, the ""trigger"" I think everyone should try for cold email is using social triggers. 

When I first started in outbound, automating emails with a {{first_name}} was so uncommon that people really thought I was emailing them. Today, your triggers need to be much better. 

In my GEX Wrapped document, I talked about how the best working triggers anyone can take advantage of all eventually wear out. 

It used to be just automating first names was crazy
Then emailing people after they raised money
Then emailing people as soon as they changed jobs. 

The trigger of the year last year for us by a long shot was using social data provided by Trigify.io. 

We would see the best reply rates when we could target people posting about their problems or news that we could ask if they were having the problem. 

I know the easy thing to do is for people to start sending emails like ""Hey I saw you liked Eric's LinkedIn post"" which some of you might get after this post. 

But it is so much better than that. 

You can use trigify to monitor your target contacts for engaging with your competitors, top influencers, or posting about their needs. 

I made a video going over Trigify that outlines how you can take advantage of it to push more targeted email campaigns.

I announced last week that we are launching campaigns for qualified companies to trial our services. So far we've launched about 15 campaigns getting at least 1 lead for 10 of the 15. (I'm the first one to say that not everyone is winning but that's what the test is for). 

We can launch so quickly because I spend more than a mortgage payment a month keeping generic domains warming to be able to rent to anyone willing to test working with us which allows us to launch immediately. 

We can launch the initial campaign so quickly because of a template we generate in Clay that you can totally do yourself. 

The copywriitng goes basically like this. 

Line 1 - call out something you would research manually about a company but we just do it with Claygent and use GPT to push the research into a first line for an email. 

Line 2 - we can test as many value propositions as you'd like. This we need our partner to write for us and we can help direct them. 

Line 3 - We use Clay to pull context about the company and relate how the company we are reaching out for so that we can help them understand how we can help their company in particular. 

Line 4 - quick CTA

P.S. line - we've been using Claygent to pull recent news or a case study from the website to give a nice sign off.

1. Cite your sources when you use data in your outreach. Theres a huge difference in the prospects eyes when you say, saw you have 50k site visitors per month and similarweb told me you have about 50k site visitors per month.

Every data platform is prone to errors, dont let their errors kill your outreach. 

2. Never ever tell people how you found something that stinks about their company and you can make it better. We learned this one from finding websites with terrible images and quality and making comments on them. 

Even though we were constructive, nobody cared and they didnt respond positively. 

3. Dont mess with trying to revive inboxes that used to work and now are landing in spam. Cut your losses and set up new ones. 

4. All email deliverability is black voodoo magic we are guessing about. If you want to send a link, an image, or a video. Try sending with it and without it and see what happens. Dont listen to blanket statements about deliverability, even if I accidentally make them. A/B testing is beautiful 

5. Dont A/B test silly things like would you like to meet this week vs. would you be open to a 15 minute conversation. 

Weve found its much more useful to test important things like the hypothesis of our messaging and the lists we are targeting.

urn:li:activity:7288197540116594688,"I'm so excited to announce today that we will begin to launch test cold email campaigns for people for free at Growth Engine X. 

About 6 months ago, I thought to myself, ""it seems that our best customers have campaigns that work immediately or within the first 3 tests.""

So I reached out to other agency owners that all said the same thing. 

Don't get me wrong, outbound is hard but you generally should be able to write basic copy and not do a backflip to get someone to respond positively to your offer. 

Any agency telling you that you need to invest with them for 3-6 months to test messaging is just trying to get you into their contract. 

Could it take 3-6 months to make an outbound funnel fully work, depends, but yes. Can you get just positive responses in a week? Also, yes.

If it takes more than that, you should be doing it on your own time or know that's what you're paying the agency to help you do. 

My next thought was, ""how could we launch campaigns for people for free and help them learn something immediately?""

So then we built what I call internally the ""Alchemy"" workflow which is a Clay table that helps us build your list and write your messaging. 

Then we needed to validate it. We worked with 10 companies to find if this strategy could get them leads initially and it worked. 

This Christmas break I worked on making it more scalable so that we can take on as many applications as possible.

I'll link the application form to this post and can send a video to anyone that wants to see how it works. 

Let me know if we can help you launch an outbound campaign for free!",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7288197540116594688,,4 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,6.0,,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes

Varun has a special way of responding to everything with ""well let's just do it now"" and then sending slack messages or making intros with extreme urgency.

urn:li:activity:7287487872880836608,"Ive been talking with some companies that have shockingly incomplete CRM data and theres usually 2 causes for it. 

1. Their CRM has some company names but is missing websites, employee headcount, HQ locations, etc.

2. They have data on contacts like name and email, but dont have things like job title and LinkedIn profile urls. 

I tell my team that with a website or a LinkedIn profile url, you can usually unlock a ton of the data you need. 

A website can lead to the next step in data providers to get account level data that you need. 

A person LinkedIn url unlocks anything you would need to know about a B2B contact. This can get you things like job titles, mobile numbers, past experience, etc. 

So heres what you can do to enrich your current data with these so you can complete your CRM data yourself. 

If you have company names but no websites. Clearbit has a free api to convert company names into websites. For anything that it doesnt find, Claygent is very good for this as well and super cheap. (Claygent is an AI agent to do B2B research for you embedded in Clays product if you havent seen it.)

If you have names and emails but no LinkedIn profiles, the clay waterfall to convert emails to LinkedIn profiles works really well, or again, using Claygent to find the url and confirm its confidence accuracy as well.

Getting over these hurdles are the first data points you need to fill your CRM with useful data.

urn:li:activity:7287200975541469185,"How to think about using relevance, triggers, or personalization in your outreach. 

Weve set up hundreds of outbound campaigns at this point and people still ask us whats the best? 

I then remind them that every business is different and your offer is more important than all of these things. 

But I think its worth defining each so that you can have buckets to brainstorm within your business. 

I find relevance to be finding something about the business that is existing for more than a moment and directly tied to the problem you solve. 

QuotaPath helps companies with automating their sales rep commission payouts. Finding companies that have reps complaining about payouts on Glassdoor or finding discrepancies in commission between an AE/Enterprise AE job opening would be relevant. 

A trigger is when something could mean change for a business in a moment of time. New Hires, New Tech installed on site, Fundraising, etc. 

The trigger of the year for us in 2024 was to reach out to people engaging with relevant LinkedIn posts powered by Trigify.io. 

Relevance and Triggers are for sure the best forms of outbound workflows you can create for your campaigns. But if you cant think of how to get this data, personalization is your next option. 

By personalization, we are generally trying to outrun the bear. By this I mean, we know that the data we found has nothing to do with the offering but the numbers speak for themselves in improving response rates. 

Things like

Mentioning case studies on the site, mentioning LinkedIn posts, blog articles, recent announcements, something about their pricing, something about their features, etc. 

We split test 4 different relevance workflow and triggers for an offshore staffing company including open job posting, companies already hiring people internationally, companies that havent hired anyone internationally, and new hires. 

The personalization we did of Hey saw your LinkedIn posts, by the way do you need offshore help? Outperformed everything else. 

This isnt to say one is better than the other. Hopefully, this can help someone think of them as a framework so that you can think about as many relevance things you want to try, then triggers, then personalizations. 

At least thats how my brain works. 

This is all secondary thinking outside of your offer and social proof. 

We dont use any of this when we cold email companies about how we can run an outbound validation test for free and 76% of the companies we run the test for get at least 1 free lead. 46% get over 5 in in the initial test.

This allows us to filter for people who have never held their current role before and are dealing with new responsibilities (or the inverse and we can find people who have done this before and change our messaging that way too). 

It's really simple and you can see the workflow here, or in the video. 

Step 1 

Upload your list of contacts and use whatever email enrichment and validation workflow you like. We love Prospeo, LeadMagic, TryKitt.ai, and Icypeas with a final validation from the Instantly.ai email validation. 

Step 2

Only enrich the profiles that you got a valid email for in order to save money. Use Clay's enrichment to get their past experience OR use your favorite linkedin enrichment API. 

Step 3

Use 4o mini to evaluate the profiles past company experience and prompt it to tell you who has never held the role before and who has.

______________

Take the person job experience and categorize whether they are a first time CEOs/Founder at {{Company Name}} or they have been CEO/Founder/President ( not vice president) /Owner/Partner before. 

Input is here - Past Job Experience - {{experienceJSON}}

If they are first-time CEO/founder then write - First Time CEO otherwise write Second Time CEO. Only output what you are over 95% sure on. Take as much time as you need to complete this task. Keep in mind that my job is on the line if you don't get this right. Thanks

We build full cold email systems and give as many templates to people for free that just want us to build something for them. Most often what they need is very simple and we can just give the internal template we use. 

Clay is simpler than you think. Theres really only 4 things that you can do. 

1. Import Data
2. Add integrations
3. Use Formulas
4. Export Data

The complexity comes from the fact that when you start with Clay you have to onboard to their platform AND what all of the other providers can do. 

Zapier is actually more complex in regards to how many custom functions there are. They dont have the same feeling of overwhelm because you come to the platform knowing you want to connect Google Sheets to Hubspot. 

When you use Clay as a new user, its tough to know which provider you want to use to find companies with open jobs for instance. 

Simply asking customer support for which integration to use if youre not sure has solved a ton of these issues. 

Even Eddy Bahnam wanted to pay me for a coaching call I didnt except payment for because I pointed out one integration that solved all their problems.

So heres a way you could build the list in Clay and Ocean.io.

To build the list in Clay, we first asked the customer for examples of companies they like to target. We reviewed the industry that they self reported to be in and the keywords in their description. 

We then pulled all companies that fit these filters for free with the Clay company data. 

Then we used Claygent to check if the company actually fit our filters. Claygent in this case was about .0006 per row using 4o mini. I manually checked 30 of them and it looked great. 

To build this list in Ocean, you can take advantage of their lookalike features as well as the industry/keyword filters. 

Their lookalike can take any website and find more like it and then you can filter after that. 

Or you can use their industry tags and filter with their company keyword search as well. 

These two paths are generally how we find niche lists for customers and I hope the workflow could help someone else find their list when filters off the shelf arent enough for you.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7284936079835561987,,5 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,1.0,,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes
urn:li:activity:7284664261216206849,"I put a commonly accepted email rule and put it to the test. Can Google Inboxes send more than 30 emails per day per inbox? 

This is one of those best practices that theres no real science behind it. We all generally agree its the number and the cold email community herds around this number. Some send a little more like 50 some send less. 

Generally, 30 emails per day per inbox is the accepted number. 

I believe you can send way more than this as long as your messaging is resonating with your audience. 

The most important part of email deliverability is that people dont mark your emails as spam. You could send 100k emails a day from Mailchimp and get in the inbox if no one marked your emails as spam. 

Reality is that people will mark your emails as spam no matter how researched and good they are so we have to prepare for that. 

A friend of mine lost their Klaviyo account and needed help to send an email blast to a warm list. They reached out to me and I said we could help but wed have to use a ton of our internal domains to get the volume out in one day they needed. 

And even though this is a warm list, they wouldnt recognize the domain. But, we put the original company name in the subject line and everywhere in the email so they wouldnt recognize it. 

I took one of the inboxes and purposely sent 1,000 emails in one day from it. I made sure I did a spam placement test before the email blast and after and both tests were 100% inbox. 

So we started thinking we could move past the 30 emails per day number. For the past 2 months we have been testing this with customers with great reply rates and have been seeing great performance. 

If you have a campaign that is getting 1 positive response for every 50 people you reach out to, Id give this a shot. 

Maybe it works with lower positive response rates but this is what we have tested so far. I also speak about the positive response rates because if you have a 5% response rate and no one is positive for sure a people are marking you as spam still. 

For those looking to ramp up some winning campaigns, try to turn up the heat on those inboxes. Make sure your metrics all hold steady but you might be able to get more bang for your buck.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7284664261216206849,,5 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,,,,,True,No,No,No
urn:li:activity:7284569944912986113,"Smartlead and Instantly.ai integrating inbox spam tests has changed how we are monitoring email deliverability at Growth Engine X. Heres an overview of what we are doing. 

First, for those that dont know, an inbox placement test is when you send a test email to a group of emails that will report back to you where the email landing. Primary, Promotions, or Spam?

Now its not perfect because your spam filter learns from what emails you mark as spam and obviously these inboxes have never marked anything as spam. 

So you should know that but I still find these tests useful enough to run now that they are integrated with the platforms. 

We are now running a test daily at 11 pm EST on all active campaigns and getting the inbox placements. 

Then, every Tuesday and Friday we will use an internal API to call to list out all inboxes that landed in spam, remove them from campaigns, and tag them so we dont use them again. 

We always keep extra inboxes warming for our customers so we will push in the extra fresh inboxes as we remove the ones landing in spam. 

Everything can be done automatically except selecting the inboxes we will use to replace the ones in spam which Im not sure is even worth automating.

In this video, I go over a common thought framework we think through at Growth Engine X when a campaign didn't work as well as we thought it would. 

Fixing any campaign comes down to changing your underlying assumptions. 

By chunking up and down, we are changing our assumptions about what a cold audience finds interesting enough to take a meeting with us. 

Chunking up is when we talk only about outcomes, past success, or second order effects of using a product or service. For us, think of how we have a history of adding pipeline to companies but also that when people hire us, often they can have their SDRs do other tasks OR slow down hiring more SDRs all together. 

Chunking down is when we talk about a tactical individual feature of our overall product or service. For us again, that could be done for you email deliverability, scoring your TAM, copywriting with the great Elyse Savaki, etc.

I had an RFP for a public company I was trying to get quick wins for. 

So I thought, ""how can I run a very quick campaign and hack attention to get as many responses as possible?""

I tried running a campaign where I made the subject line of our campaign ""Taylor Ham or Pork Roll?"" and emailed sales leaders in New Jersey. The whole message was about the offer and we named new AEs on the team so we know they were growing the sales team. We only explained the Subject line in the P.S. literally just saying

""P.S. I know you get emails like this all the time. I'm from Jersey too and wanted to have a fun way to cut through the noise and see where you stood.""

In New Jersey, there's a silly debate of whether or not a sandwich is called a Taylor Ham or Pork Roll sandwich. It's such a big deal, Barack Obama opened with asking about it at his Rutgers commencement speech. 

If you see the responses, you can see it got people's attention for sure and very positively I might add. 

So sometimes we will run something like this to just try to get feedback as quickly as possible. 

Be warned though, I would only use this to get feedback and a quick win as it's not very scalable. Also, try to use it on a debate that's silly and you actually have knowledge of.

Choose the sort by lowest rating so you don't get any good reviews. Or the opposite if you want the good reviews.

But Eric, this should be working. We already have name brand customers. How are people not responding to our cold emails?

When customers say this, a pit used to form in my stomach and I wouldnt have an answer for them. Its a great question, the customer is basically asking&

How is it possible for a company to have great customers that love them, but no one responds to your cold emails?

The best answer I have for you today is that theres a huge difference between an offer that converts people who know they have the problem and know your brand. Then theres an offer that converts people who have never heard of you and you can get them on a meeting. 

I think a lot of this comes down to things like problem awareness, brand awareness, market saturation, timing of the buyer, how big of a problem are you solving, etc. But what can we DO about these things? How can we change our messaging enough to make a difference if our first campaigns dont work? 

Heres 3 ideas I go to for now and Id love to hear if you have more. 

1. Chunking Up and Chunking Down

For chunking up, change your messaging to speak blatantly about outcomes and not individual mechanisms. Apparently, no one cares about the way you use cold email to drive more pipeline. Talk about your past success with other companies instead as social proof. 

For chunking down, try changing your messaging to talk about super sexy tactical things that you do that are very valuable to your prospects. Most companies solve more than one problem. Talk about the outcomes some of your features solve and see if anyone resonates with an individual tiny outcome that can get them hooked on what you do more broadly. 

Again, no one cares that I use cold email to get leads but maybe they are incredibly frustrated that their sales team is currently getting a 5% open rate.

2.  Make Them Think About the Pain Differently

Josh Braun is the best at this. 

Change ""do you need someone to do your taxes"" to ""how do you know your current tax accountant is using every legal loophole to get you as much money back as possible.""

This had a very real increase in response rates for us. 

3. Create An Offer Specifically For Cold Traffic 

Again, if I were to send an email saying I could get someone leads I'd look like 12 other nerds in prospect's inbox every day. 

But what if I offered to launch a campaign for absolutely free with proof that these free campaigns have produced results for our new customers in December? Wouldn't you respond more to that?

urn:li:activity:7274777906105442306,"Here are some changes we saw with email deliverability this past year. 

I still hold that the more things change, the more things stay the same. 

More important than anything when sending cold emails is the rate at which people are marking you as spam. You could send cold emails from mail chimp with 0 warm up. 

If no one marks you as spam youd probably be fine barring automated Google flags on text etc. 

This year we saw some changes around email sending volume, domain warmup, and reusing domains. 

1) We reduced our emails sent from 50 to 30 per day per inbox. Still 2 inboxes per domain. 

I dont really have full evidence that 2 inboxes is better than 3 but its definitely better than 10. 

2) We have seen campaigns that get are getting good response rates be able to push the inboxes past even 50 per day. 30 is just our starting point. 

We used to be able to also set up our inboxes and in a pinch launch low volume without waiting 3 weeks for them to warm up. 

These days we are staying prepared for even inboxes not being ready after a full 3 weeks. Again, this comes down to the campaign but we cant pull the trigger as fast as we could in the past. 

4) In the past, we also could see inboxes reduce on inboxes. Then we would warm them up for 2-4 weeks and relaunch on those domains. This year, we have been seeing if reply rates go down, we cant recycle those inboxes. 

This past May/June/July was crazy for email delivery. We had customers we would warm domains for 3 weeks and then get absolutely no responses on the inboxes. 

It was very difficult to onboard new customers reliably and we started setting up far more inboxes than we though we needed for everyone as an insurance policy. 

5) Towards the end of the year, outlook inbox spam filters became unbelievably strict to the point it became popular to just not send to outlook. I dont expect it to stay that way forever but it is something to be watching. 

6) Fundamentally, our strategy for email deliverability has stayed broadly the same. Sometimes people ask to pay me for coaching on our strategy and its so simple I really cant take their money. 

Still 2 inboxes per domain. Google or outlook inboxes

Alphoric is my main partner for Google Inboxes. 

30 emails sent per day 15 minutes between sends. 

Warmup for 3 weeks. 

We keep enough inboxes so we can send our clients goal send volume in 3 batches. So if they want to send 1000 emails per day. I keep the ability to send 3000 emails per day on hand and we just split the inboxes into batches. 

If you are running your own outbound, Id still recommend keeping 50% of your necessary volume warming at all times in case anything goes wrong.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7274777906105442306,,6 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,2.0,,,,,True,No,No,No

Now if you dont know who G is, hes a legend in growth marketing, particularly in outbound and you should listen to some podcasts hes been featured on. 

Johnathan Dane and I have agreed we have man crushes on the man. 

Ive learned way more than 3 things from him but hey, this is LinkedIn and we gotta keep it snappy. 

1) before getting crazy, return to first principles. 

We were working on a campaign and things were working for months until we had an email deliverability problem. We were discussing it and how my team was handling and I asked for feedback. 

He said that in times like this he returns to first principles and reminded me to segment each part of the problem individually instead of ramming a ton of fixes like I usually do. 

2) Send emails people would have to be jerks to not respond to (if you can). 

He outlined a strategy he created for Gorgias where they would scrape instagram posts for comments from customers of brands that had support questions that werent being resolved. 

They would screenshot those and send them to the company with no ask and just say hey, not sure if anyone got to this but it seemed like this persons question wasnt answered

They would only talk about Gorgias after the customer success leader responded thanking them for the heads up. 

I only add (if you can here) because of course this is very tough to do and not every brand can really do this. But that leads to another lesson G has taught me. 

3) There is no limit to creativity you can bring in outbound. Almost everything is worth testing. 

G talks publicly about a campaign he ran where they made march madness bets to people about their alumnus team. 

If they won, theyd send a gift card. If they lost, the prospect promised to take a meeting. Win or lose, most people still took the meeting.

urn:li:activity:7272603546322100224,"Here are some of the changes from 2023-2024 that we noticed in our fulfillment for customers at Growth Engine X. 

Ive been taking time to reflect on what we learned this year from our customers campaigns to rewrite my 2024 outbound guide. 

Here are a couple things Ive noticed. 

1) Email deliverability got tougher, but the principles remained the same. 

2) Catch all validation became more prevalent in 2024. 

3) 2023 was the year of spintax, multi domain/multi inbox sending. 2024 was about using AI to scale what you would normally say manually and will become more important in 2025. 

4) The copywriting of even the spam in your inbox has gotten a lot better. Breaking the mold of the classic, 4 line template was a change most of our customers benefited from. 

5) In 2023, we were constantly launching 1 or 2 campaigns at a time for customers. In 2024, we were split testing 8 campaigns at a time regularly. 

6) Some classic triggers that would create great reply rates boosts in campaigns have fallen slightly. Open jobs was a hit in 2022 and 2023. I dont think we have more than 4 evergreen open jobs campaigns running currently. Perhaps the signal was over used?

7) Overall, the customers that have been working with us for 2 years saw a slight year over year decrease in reply rates when comparing the exact same campaign numbers from Nov to Nov. 

8) I thought 2024 would require us to be 50/50 google and outlook. We were mostly google through the whole year. 

9) We started implementing more and more AI lead scoring into our lists. Some filters out of the platforms were just not cutting it. 

10) We radically increased our usage of Claygent as 4o mini made it more affordable and greatly accurate.

But you know who has a great sense of lots of competitor information? 

Google

You're going to get a ton of answers from great data companies like Crunchbase, G2, and Zoominfo.

In this template that I share, you can automatically do a Google Search that I outlined above and then AI will review each of the snippets that are returned. 

What I trained the AI to look for is to name the company that is mentioned most often so that you aren't trusting one data provider to get you the data, you have multiple data providers. AI is simply outputting the one that gets mentioned the most often. 

See how often Apollo is mentioned as a Clay competitor in the search in the image below?

urn:li:activity:7271886318731767808,"Here's a new process we've been doing for email deliverability is something I've wanted to do for awhile and we should have gotten to it sooner. 

In the past, we have basically set up 2 batches of inboxes for customers. One that we expected to use, and another that we would use in case things went wrong. 

We are switching formats so that we are diversified AND we can quite possibly age domains for 3 months before using them. 

Now we are setting up 4 batches of inboxes for customers. 

We first estimate how many emails they'll need to be sending per day so that each batch is capable of hitting it. 

In Batch 1 are google inboxes 

In batch 2 are outlook inboxes provided by our friends at Hypertide.io

Batch 3 is a combination of both inboxes

Batch 4 is another combination of both inboxes. 

We are finding right now to get the best performance with google and outlook inboxes need to warm longer which is why we get started like this. 

But what we are doing is not using all inboxes at the same time. In the past, we were less organized and I would just throw in inboxes as we felt we needed them even if they were all only sending 5 emails per day to hit the customer's goals. 

With this method we stay much more organized AND as long as things are looking good the other inboxes just keep on warming and we won't touch them. 

As domain age becomes more and more important we can lean into this strategy to have warmer and warmer inboxes so that if we ever burn some we can regroup, restrategize, and refresh copy. and launch from new inboxes that are even warmer than the ones we used before. 

Honestly, posting this because we should have been doing this the entire time and I just kept putting it on the back burner. It took me 5 hours this past Saturday to organize everything to be able to do this but it was well worth it.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7271886318731767808,,6 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,,,,,True,No,No,Yes
urn:li:activity:7270810485422178304,"Should you include images in your cold emails or not? Don't listen to the gurus. Do the math. 

Convention wisdom in cold email is to not send any images, links, open tracking, crazy signatures or viruses (for legal purposes this is a joke). 

And for the most part with our customers, we follow this to the T. 

But sometimes, an image really helps either compel someone about a value proposition OR can further prove we have done our research. 

In those instances we will take the risk and send the image and of course just test if it's worth it. 

Think of the math. 

Let's say you send an email with no images or anything and let's say we think 60 people out of 100 saw it, and you only got 1 of them to respond. 

On the other hand, let's say you send an email with your image and we estimate 40 people out of 100 saw it and now you get 5 people to respond. 

Doesn't that make it completely worth it to send the image? 

There's wisdoms that get touted as best practices because honestly, they are. But once you start doing outbound, think about how breaking some rules here and there could increase your responses.

Industry shifts, employee headcount shifts, large role shifts, etc all could be used for some great little tid bits to add to follow up emails. 

Clay will even give you the summary of what they did in that role which can be great to mine for keywords or use AI to do some analysis.

urn:li:activity:7270085689961074688,"Which website visitor enrichment should you use. My answer? Probably as many as you can afford AND you have ROI with. 

So first at baseline, should you be using website visitor deanonymization? From what I can tell, yes. 

We ran a test for Instantly.ai using their own website visitor product. We didn't say we find people on the website. We simply sent them the same best winning email we use all the time. 

It drove a 3x increase in positive responses. Great ROI there. Especially since I would assume these people are much more down funnel and they just didn't book a call or sign up for some reason. 

Now which should you use? 

Like I said in my first line, I think as many as you can handle. 

To my very small understanding of what these platforms are doing, they are buying IP data from companies that collect information about users for free and then they are using that data and connecting the dots for B2B purposes. 

Think of getting free wifi at the airport. They aren't doing that for ""FREE"", your data is being sold. They have your IP address and most likely your personal email address. Doesn't take a space engineer to connect the dots. You consented when you checked yes to the terms and conditions without reading them. So totally legal, fair game. 

I know Instantly is doing other things than that because of their email sending data but as far as the others, that's my understanding and I will highlight them in the comments or edit this post if anyone would want me to change anything. 

This being said, this data comes from so many different places that who knows which provider really has the best coverage. 

Some people live and breathe Rb2b data, others think the data coverage isn't great. Probably just you're not testing enough or they for now don't have your coverage on the three days you plugged them in. 

We had a customer want to go crazy with the deanonymization and they installed everything they could. Each platform had their good and bad data sure but every platform we tried was ROI positive and sometimes they found different people at the same time. Which fine, that's the way the game goes. 

I'd get less in the weeds of testing these platforms by installing the pixel, visiting your own website and then getting mad they don't identify you correctly. 

Use Clay to enrich the data. Filter for only people you'd reach out to in a regular campaign anyway. Don't tell people that you are reaching out after they visited the site. Send your normal email. No harm done if the platform was wrong and deanonymized the wrong person. Test where you get your ROI from. 

The platforms we've had the best time implementing and integrating have been 

RB2B 
Instantly.ai of course

urn:li:activity:7269745957557219329,"Trigify.io is making one of my favorite playbooks so much easier, we tried something kind of crazy and it increased positive responses by 3x for one customer. 

If you've been following me for awhile, you might have heard of the playbook I used to start Growth Engine X.

I emailed sales leaders who were active on LinkedIn and offered to collect their last 10 posts for everyone that engaged with them and give them that list for free. 

That would start a conversation of how they could use that list and maybe use us for other outbound services. 

The problem with this is it took so many resources to collect the lists and put accounts at risk that it didn't scale a ton. 

With Trigify's social listening, this is so much easier to do that it gave me a thought. 

Some of our customers really don't have any great lead magnet. I really don't like sending emails without any value in them so sometimes we have to let it fly. 

But pulling Trigify data was so easy, I wondered if we could take a company with 0 lead magnet and use the data to increase our responses. 

Basically in the P.S. I added ""I really don't like sending emails without value, but as you can imagine, it's hard for me to get started without talking first. 

This doesn't have anything to do with what we do, but I pulled the people that engaged with your company LinkedIn page with all of their data so you can filter by people you might find important. 

I won't send an email with a link so your IT department doesn't hate me so just let me know that you want it.""

Longest P.S. ever right? 

I know, but we got great responses to it like the one I put in the post and are currently thinking about which other customers and scaling it up. 

Maybe someone remind me to drop the before and after screenshot too (I'm batch scheduling this post). 

I do realize this still might not apply to everyone and we were targeting sales leaders here so it was still valuable to them in their position. I don't think HR people will care about this. 

But it has gotten me thinking about adding value to every email even if it has nothing to do with your actual offer. 

This is still purely experimental and we have gotten 1 very positive proof point. As we try it out more, I can report back on it more. 

*Like anything else you read from us nerds on LinkedIn. Take this with a grain of salt. It worked for one campaign so far and the point of this post is to think about adding value to your emails even if it doesn't have a clear connection with what you are actually selling. The worst you can do is have someone interested in the lead magnet but not your thing.

urn:li:activity:7269372374192476160,"How data providers get their data is a bit of a black box and hopefully this post can pierce the veil for those that are looking the ""Best"" data provider. 

Understanding how data providers get their data is important for understanding which data providers to go to and when to use them vs. others. 

As you can imagine, some data providers don't openly talk about how they get their data so I'll speak to some that I know for sure how they are getting their data and then give inferences based on my tests and what the company has told me. 

- Email finders are essentially just guessing email addresses. I know it looks super magical, but think about it. Everyone's email is the same 11 permutations of a full name. They guess all variations and give you the one that's valid. 

This makes the question ""how good is your data coverage globally"" not really a good question. The way the email data is found is mostly the same. You're basically asking how good a platform is at getting linkedin profiles outside the US and/or bringing in any other information from those countries. The email finding is not the problem. 

A huge limitation to this method though is that some domains are catch all domains and don't have a way to verify the email without some kind of ""Catch all verification"" or just sending an email. 

Big differences in providers come from other underlying factors past just this guessing game but also how much they invest in their IPs to do the validation from.  

- ""Catch all verification"" if done instantly is usually happening because companies are trying to log in an email address to Google and Outlook. If an email exists it moves to the password screen. If it doesn't exist, it won't change the window. They do other things but this is the most common. 

- Instantly catch all verification is synthesizing the data on their platform and letting you get access to it to find what happened when other users tried to email the email address you uploaded. 

Your favorite data providers for list building are all doing some form of LinkedIn scraping so you are buying a LinkedIn scraper with an email finder on top of it. That's why if you're targeting plumbers, you're usually not going to be satisfied with most data provider's coverage. 

Builtwith - they are getting technographic data from technologies installed on someone's website. That's why it works so well to find people use Webflow but not great for finding people using Quickbooks. 

D7 Lead Finder is scraping google maps which is why you get better coverage of those off LinkedIn folks. 

I could keep going with data providers but I say this to make the point that many times people say ""their data is bad"" often comes from a person not understanding how the sausage is made. 

And maybe the data is bad but if you understand how the underlying methodology happens you can make better evaluations of your current data providers.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7269372374192476160,,6 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,,,,,True,No,No,Yes

1) start an email with ""I hope this email finds you well"" 

2) start an email with ""Hey {{first_name}}, I saw you're the {{title}} at {{company_name}} and wanted to reach out."" I'm sorry =œ Will GPT for I have sinned. 

3) add a ""Sent from my iPhone"" post script. Maybe it worked 2 years ago but no one believes you now.

4) Send an email just ""thoughts?"" I know there are some of you this works for, I just find it to be lazy and not add any value. This worked when the google API changed and you could thread emails. Now it's so common place. 

5) Send 8 email step long sequences

6) send an email campaign trusting when a data provider says their emails are all valid. I love you all but I still don't trust anyone. 

7) Tell someone how they messed up something on their site or how they messed up something at all. We used to send emails saying that people messed up their links on their website or made SEO mistakes. Critiquing someone from a cold email never goes well. 

8) Send emails without cleaning the company names and normalizing them.

9) send emails without a {{first_name}} variable - only exception is sending to local business owners and even then we have a claygent / website scraper to help us with that. 

10) increasing volume without validating the offer and just hoping more emails will solve broken messaging by finding a needle in a haystack.

urn:li:activity:7267175262335688704,"One of my favorite Clay uses across multiple clients is to use Claygent to find a case study for .0006 straight from a prospect's website. 

And this can manifest in multiple ways. 

So we can send messaging knowing they already have public case studies.

So we can send messaging about the success they've had with other companies and how their customers specifically talk about that success. 

So we can create lookalikes to that company and send them more leads for free. 

So we can create P.s. lines calling out the case study

And the list can kind of go on. 

If you're looking to do this, I have a clay template that you can copy into your workspace that finds the case study and uses AI to verify the case study is positive and comes from the source website.

We still have campaigns to this day that our best performer is just noticing their LinkedIn post and then asking them to take a meeting. 

I know, it's not fancy but the data shows it really works. 

Clay released the ability to scrape YouTube videos and get their transcripts as well too which I think is going to unlock similar underutilized targeting and outreach tactics. 

You must first have the link to the actual video that you want to find the transcript of. So I made a template you can copy that can take any website and 

1) Find their YouTube account listed on the website 

2) Sse Claygent to find an individual video (change the prompt to find a specific video. This is prompted to find the most recent)

urn:li:ugcPost:7266093640446316544,"Heres the story of how I jumped out of a plane with the US Army because of cold email. 

I promise this isnt click bait. 

It was 2020 and I had just started my career. Veronica Martinez told me about this magical thing called mail merge after I told her I was copying and pasting emails all day. 

From there I was hooked on cold email. 

One of my first projects at the chamber of commerce I worked at was to help the US Army with their recruiting efforts. 

I just started getting good enough that I could scrape lists together and email them from 2 inboxes. 

They told me they wish they could get a list of guidance counselors together but didnt know where to start. I already made the list so I offered to help. 

They said they wouldnt be able to pay me because wed have to go through the government contractor procurement which would take too much time. They said theyd make it up to me in a different way. 

So I helped them out together a virtual job fair (remember it was the middle of COVID). 

That job fair was to them the most effective student engagement event the branch participated in since the lockdowns

So we kept doing them. Month after month. 

Id get my list together and send hundreds of emails per day from one inbox to get sponsors and guidance counselors together support the event. 

And every month it was hit not just for the Army but for our other participating companies and it was all driven by cold email more than anything else. 

The Army did find a way to pay me. When the Golden Knights came to town, I was invited to do a jump with them and got an experience Ill never forget. 

You can tell Im actually a little sick on the ground at the end of the video because I asked my jumper to do a back flip in the air which he did and it did not sit well with my stomach >#

LinkedIn and Google maps being scraped the most often. 

Somehow, pandamatch isn't just scraping these platforms, they are doing something with domain registrations or following links that finds my burner domains.

When you email someone hiring for a graphic designer, it often doesn't mean they need graphic design services. Maybe they already decided to take this position in house. Maybe they are someone that gets slammed with emails from recruiters using this same playbook every day. 

We try to take this playbook one step further and either use a keyword match to look for words in the job description that we can further refine our campaigns for OR we use AI to figure out a particular reason they are making this hire and how it relates to what we're selling. 

This is I believe the next natural step of the playbook.

1) Reach out to people that are using tools you integrate well with. 

This is great when you know they are using HubSpot and you have a great HubSpot integration that solves a niche problem. 

2) You can reach out to your competitor's customers. 

Possibly, my least favorite way to use the data because the way you find someone is the reason they'll leave but hey, it does get results. Don't bash the competitor and try to share verifiable data on why people make the switches. 

3) Use the technology as a understanding of intent or budget

No one is rolling around with a limited budget saying to themselves, ""We need every ZoomInfo product installed on our site right now""

I made a full YouTube video on this that I can link at the end, but I'm trying to create a checklist of campaigns with one goal. 

If you follow these campaigns, you will get predictable leads or you won't get predictable leads and I'm trying to assess if you follow this checklist it will help you know if further assessment is necessary. 

We have implemented this as a checklist for 20 customers now and for 15 we have gotten a predictable lead system built with it. 4 we couldn't make the offer work. And there was 1 that still keeps me up at night because this system didn't get them leads but their team did get leads. 

I want to spread this checklist far and wide to see if anyone else comes up with ideas that are applicable to almost any business and is worth testing. 

We launch everything in batches. Far longer explanation on my YouTube video

Batch 1 Value prop testing

-Lookalike campaigns
-Campaign testing 3 value props as an A/B/C test. One AI generated line talking about how the company can specifically help their company
- Creative ideas campaign. Quick messaging with 3 bullet points generated by AI about how we can help. 

This is our first messaging test. I like this because we can write messaging and use no AI so we don't have to guess as much on what to say to prospects. And then it ramps up with the AI campaigns to send more relevant generated text. I like including the AI because it might say something valuable we might not have necessarily thought about. 

Batch 2 Trigger testing

We keep similar messaging and see if changing the list makes things better. 

We try common triggers like new in role, linkedin posts with keywords, company news about topic, tech installation, custom requests, etc. 

We are testing here if the messaging needs to be sent a further refined list with triggers than we thought in the beginning. 

Batch 3 More Messaging Testing

Here we have 10-12 templates we use that throw all AI out the window and we just do things like copying other styles, sending emails on the weekends, sending emails and mentioning other people on the team, etc. 

Just to make sure AI wasn't the problem and we can try tons of value based and pain based messaging.

Batch 4 Unscalable Wins

We launch things like targeting people that like certain linkedin pages or talk about things on LinkedIn, or they are members of certain LinkedIn groups. We also send Jed Mahrle style feedback campaigns to learn from the market. 

I don't love these campaigns because often the list is very short and it's not repeatable.

urn:li:activity:7262218857174519809,"I asked Alex Hormozi what to do if you don't have a lead magnet already and have a tough time creating one. Paraphrasing what he said here. 

- Many times, there is an onboarding step or process that needs to be done before you get started with all of your customers. Think about making that a free process or giveaway. 

I asked this to him because many of our customers at Growth Engine X don't have a lead magnet. And not because they haven't tried. They feel they can't provide value without receiving a ton of information from the customer, getting access to integrations, or a bunch of other reasons. 

Which of course I completely get. 

But there's definitely something you do in your sales process or your onboarding process that can be done for people to get a taste of working with you. 

I've thought a lot about this so here's three that we try to weave into our messaging. 

1) Is there something you can actually do for them for free? Do they know that other people charge for that normally?

2) Is there something that you have insights on in the business that they might not know about? Every business has some form of information arbitrage to it. What do you know that they would love to know? 

I know not everyone can give a list of every saas company in the world and add value to their prospects and they might not have the bandwidth to do their first onboarding step for everyone for free. 

But everyone has insights they can give. 

We have insights on sending 1.5 M emails per month. We have insights because we are the largest clay user by enrichment volume. We have insights from working within so many industries. 

You have those insights too and they often perform very well as a pseudo lead magnet you don't have to prepare for and can just share on the call!

Let me know if you give this a try.

P.S. I just want to reiterate, I have never worked with the Hormozi team and I'm not saying he even told me this privately. He said this on my interview with him that you can check out here.

Which begs the question, should you send emails on holidays? Here's how we think about it. 

If it's a huge holiday most people take off of work (think Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Years, Fourth of July), we turn off email campaigns. 

If it's a holiday where some people take off of work and some people don't (like today), we keep the campaigns turned on. 

From what I can tell with our internal data, if we turned campaigns off today it wouldn't have been the end of the world. I'd say it could go either way and comes down to preference.

Here's our workflow to find the sustainability page of an e commerce brand, then take a screenshot to show them that we found it, but completely automatically. 

So we can send an email like 

Hey {{first_name}} -- found from your sustainability page that {{sustainability focus}} is integral to your brand. 

{{Insert Screenshot}}

{{insert the rest of the messaging}}


The stack we need is Clay and a screenshot service that can save the images. We used screenshotapi(dot)net. 

Step 1: We used Claygent to find if a company had a sustainability mission and we asked it to find the link to the mission page. 

Step 2: GPT 4o mini is so cheap we used it to confirm this was a sustainability page and that it was sourced from the company in our input. 

Step 2a: Again, GPT 4o mini is so cheap that if it didn't confirm we would rerun another Claygent and exclude the first page just in case it wasn't the right one. 

When we did this, it was so long ago, Claygent's tech was different. I bet we wouldn't even need this anymore but just wanted to include it. 

Step 3: We would use the data we got from the page to infer what the mission was about to fill in the {{sustainability focus}} variable. 

Step 4: We would take the link that Claygent output for us as the source and feed it into the Screenshot API to be able to pass the screenshot to the smartlead campaign. 

All done automatically and resulting in 62 leads in 3 weeks for our customer just based in the Australian market.

urn:li:activity:7257107681507708928,"Here's a tweak we make in outbound campaigns that aren't working with a case study to go along with it. I hope this helps someone think about their copywriting a little differently today. 

We were helping a company that helps executives of successful businesses save money on their taxes. 

They had some great past case studies that we highlighted and we followed the same general framework most others do. 

Hey - {{first line about why we are reaching out to them in particular, in this case the executive was a part of a merger or acquisition recently}}

{{quick explanation of what we do}}

{{share case study and social proof}}

{{call to action}}

Probably the most rinse and repeat but also tried and true template there is. 

We basically weren't getting any responses. 

After we try this template and we present the value proposition etc, as our next campaign, I like to think through, ""what is the implicit objection we are bringing up with this email and how can we answer it in the email?""

With a tax savings service, I think many people are thinking things like 

1. I already have an accountant with a tax plan
2. Case study is cool but how can I actually believe you?
3. I don't have time for this
etc. 

So the way we went about tackling 1 was we shifted our messaging.

Instead of sharing how we can help and the benefits of the offering, we poked the bear as Josh Braun says to do.

Shifting the messaging to 

""How do you know your current accountant is helping you save as much money on your taxes as possible?""

Then sharing our case study. 

Finally, we started getting repeatable responses. 

My takeaway is that one of the first things to try after a campaign isn't working so hot is to think about what is the objection in the prospect's mind and how can you think about overcoming it. 

For those who might also bring this up, we do think about this when we are first writing the initial campaign but sometimes it gets too long or we don't want to be assuming/bringing up an objection they don't have which is why we might leave it out. 

No harm at all for using this thinking in the first campaigns you run.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7257107681507708928,,7 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,1.0,,,,,True,No,No,No

Here's what happened with the campaign. The campaign was to sell facebook Ad services. Pretty generic, nothing crazy for this campaign because we wanted to test these variables by themselves. 

Variation A included a case study with a company basically everyone has heard about. 

Variation B included the same exact case study AND a money back guarentee. 

We sent to 10,000 contacts verified by either LeadMagic, Icypeas, Prospeo, or Kitt AI. 

5,000 received Variation A

5,000 received Variation B

Which do you think got more positive responses?

Conventional wisdom would say it's the case study and the money guarantee? Who doesn't love an offer they can't refuse right? 

The data says that Variation A with just a case study got 3 times as many positive responses though. 

This obviously is just for one offer and you should do your own testing because maybe response rates will go up for you including a case study AND a guarantee. You should always be testing.

I think that the guarantee might actually be hurting this offer because it feels like it's too good to be true. Seeing an email where some one promises something will work or they'll pay money out of their own pocket, I think feels a little over the top to prospects. 

In this case, I think that's what happened. Sometimes we will even pull back what happened in a case study to see if we can increase responses by sending a more believable case study. 

Of course never inflate your numbers but it's only a happy surprise to increase your numbers after they responded and you have a sales conversation with them.

Theres so much information on how to pull lists, set up inboxes, come up with campaign ideas, etc. 

Ive had this conversation more than once so I wanted to make some bullet points. 

Dont hire an agency if

- you dont have product market fit or case studies. You can be running campaigns for yourself be try cheaply to see what works and then scale with an agency. 

- you want to control the list building process. If you feel you need to control the list because of all your parameters then keep that work in house. 

- you have campaigns you know you already want to test. 

Im sure there are more reasons but I have to jump on a call. 

Do work with an agency like us if you want

- Proven campaign strategies out of the box. I dedicated a whole YouTube video to a checklist of campaigns we ask all of our clients if the campaign would apply to their market. 

- to outsource the time it takes to run sophisticated campaigns. 

- get access to basically unlimited data. We have so many data providers working with us, some of our customers get their ROI not even from the leads we send over but even just in the data costs we can save them on. 

- to work with someone that can scale an idea that already works. We can set up 400 inboxes per day so volume really isnt a problem if you need to scale something you already see working.

Zenrows is one of my favorite scraping tools that we often pair with Serper or Claygent to find the page we are looking to scrape and then we will pull the data with Zenrows.

Zenrows has a built in proxy network that can scrape programmatic SEO pages and I love using them a ton because they can parse the data for you as well.

1) Scrape web traffic numbers from Similarweb. 

We use it all the time to find the web traffic data similar web puts on their pages. 

Keep in mind these are estimates so only use them to filter your list and if you use the data in the campaign, make sure you mention you pulled it from similar web because if it's very wrong, this data point will count against you. 

2) Scraping G2 pages for content

With their proxy network, scraping G2 for positive or negative review content is easy with Zenrows

3) Scraping content from the home page of a company.

Sometimes we need to get more content from the home page of a company to find keywords or to use in AI. Zenrows powers our content collection here. 

If we need to get more pages than just the website, we will use Firecrawl for this. 

4) Scraping job boards for content

We can use Zenrows to get the list of jobs or just the content of a specific job posting. 

5) Scraping funding/recent news information from Owler

Can never go wrong with getting more funding information. Pair this with Serper to increase your match rate in finding programmatic pages.

Crawl

In this stage, you really need to just get an understanding of the platform. Keep in mind, there's only 5 things you can do in Clay. 

Import data, Enrich Data, Use AI, use formulas, and send your data elsewhere. All of the nuance falls under these buckets. 

You should be using Clay as an operating system to do all of the things you'd have to jump around between providers to be able to do.

Validate emails
Enrich for more emails
Clean Company names
Clean titles or first names if you need
Use their data to confirm someone still works at a company
When everything is done running, send to your CRM or your outbound tool.

Walk

In this stage, I'd start thinking about, ""What does my team need to research manually or switch between tools to find and how can we automate this?""

Learn how to use integrations like Builtwith, PredictLeads, Serper, and ZenRows to find popular triggers. 

These are the most requested triggers at our agency and the tool we use in Clay to find the data.

- New in role - Clay People Data
- Hiring for open jobs - Predict Leads
- Tech installed - Builtwith
- Very specific keywords on LinkedIn profiles - Clay People Data
- Past company experience at current customers - Clay People Data
first time in role - Clay People Data
- Golden ICP - multiple providers and conditional formulas (maybe a whole post will be made on this.  
- New Fundraise - Owler by using Zenrows
- Employee Head count growth increase or decrease - Clay People Data


Run

We like to call these Trigger Waterfalls internally at Growth Engine X. 

Why is it called a trigger waterfall? Well it's 2024 and everything has to be a waterfall but also because it really is a waterfall. 

Here's how the workflow goes.

We first check if these things are true about the prospect or company.

1) was the company founded in the past 2 years
2) is the person new in their role
3) have they made a post on LinkedIn mentioning ""hiring"" keywords
4) Do they already hire people internationally

If any of these are true, we launch a campaign specifically for that messaging.

If none of these are true, these people are still a fit for our ICP we just didn't find a trigger. So we randomly send them to one of four campaigns.

1) very short and to the point campaign
2) a campaign that leans heavily into our client's past success and case studies
3) a campaign that generates 3 ideas that our client can help the prospect's company specifically
4) a campaign where we send a meme and messaging around the meme. 

Each campaign has it's own messaging and we can refill all of them with a simple csv import anytime. Once we set it up the first time, it's all set. 

If you are trying to do something like this, make sure you use a ton of conditional formulas so leads don't go into multiple campaigns!

All of these campaigns are getting leads but comment which campaign you think is working the best as we are already running this for 2 weeks now and it's crushing!

If you want to test outbound before investing in professional help you can absolutely do a ton of great tests without breaking the bank. 

You'll just need an email infrastructure to send from, a way to build lists and a framework for copywriting. 

1) If you want to use Smartlead for sending, use Hypertide.io to set up inboxes (they have been a life saver lately).

If you want to use Instantly.ai, they have a done for you setup right in the app. 

2) Use a tool that you can get free trials on really quickly like Clay or Wiza to build lists, get more emails with Prospeo, Icypeas, or LeadMagic

3) Test your offer with some best practices in copywriting. 

- Clear offer
- Emails under 75 words. Under 50 is better
- Try to group your list by something they all have in common so you don't need AI and can be broadly relevant. 

Lavender =œ for those that are really just getting started has great resources and the team posts great things as well. 

Super easy to just test outbound before you need to think about going crazy and scaling. 

And if you've read this post this far, we are even working on a way to launch campaigns for people just from a website input. The workflow end to end is done but I need to do more testing before we make it public. Pretty soon we might even be able to launch campaigns for people for free and do their initial testing for them. 

I'll post more when it's ready. It's already proven to generate leads just from a website input but I don't think it's ready for anyone to just fill out a form. I think we need to build it's own case studies for it/improve it before people use it and then feel disappointed that it might fail them. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. Check out this video on how we think about testing offers for our customers if you need some guidance on campaign strategy.

urn:li:activity:7247625197585858562,"If you have customers that are possibly located near other customers (think you sell software to local businesses) here's how you can name drop those customers easily in your email. 

Most outbound workflows work based on more or less if/then statements. 

If the data says X then we output Y.

But if you have thousands of customers and want to name one close to another customer, it can be difficult to do this without AI because getting the distance between so many possible places is very difficult. 

But keep in mind, if you ask if New York City is closer to Boston or Chicago, it will know the difference.

So when we are working with a customer that has many local business customers, we will enrich all of their customers for their addresses and then name their closest customer by uploading all of the customer name data and the address data into an AI prompt. 

Split these up by States if you need to save on costs. Even with 4o mini this can get expensive. 

Then just run your list so you can output the nearest customer to your prospect so they not only see a case study but a case study they might recognize!

urn:li:activity:7247266628759908353,"We send a lot of cold email but lately we've been taking a lot of warm email deliverability consulting calls so I wanted to make a post about the most common problems we see. 

I define cold email as sending email to people that have not opted in and warm email as people that have opted in to receive emails from you. 

Many of the same rules apply with some subtle differences. 

1) DNS settings must be set up properly. Often times, this is overlooked and you can use tools like Mx Toolbox and Mailgenius to check if your email is set up correctly from a DNS stand point. 

The most common problem I see is that people will rightly put the DKIM records for their sending tools but didn't totally authenticate one versus the other. So they might have one from Google that's perfect, but the one from Klaviyo is messed up. 

I've also seen people have too many SPF records competing for authentication. They'll have a separate DNS record for SPF from Sendgrid, a SPF from Klaviyo, and a SPF from Google. We've found that sometimes (I know email gurus, bear with me) SOMETIMES having all of these SPF records one right after the other doesn't get authenticated in MailGenius or Mx Toolbox but when you stack them into one record.

2) You aren't complaining to your ESP enough. 

In cold email, if you're having problems with a domain, many times your only answer is that you have to start over with a fresh domain because there's no support you can call and ask for help rotating IPs or anything. 

If you can prove to your ESP that you have received permission from every person you're emailing to email them, it is their job to help you inbox. Many times you can take a Mailgenius report to them and get them to help you sort things out. 

3) You're not sending from a dedicated IP or the IP you've been given doesn't have good reputation. 

You can tell if this is an issue if you're marketing emails are being sent to spam but your google or outlook emails that you send manually are going straight to the inbox. 

This often means that the IP of the ESP that you're using is having an issue. If you're not on a dedicated IP, you should request one and it shouldn't be wildly expensive. 

If that still doesn't fix it, I would ask the ESP to swap the IPs for you. 

I know this isn't cold email related but we've been helping some folks getting their regular marketing emails out of spam and these have been the main issues I've been seeing and what we did to fix the issue.

urn:li:activity:7246943624670715904,"Here's a Claygent prompt that can help find case studies, media mentions, product names, and general company information for under .002 per company.

I made this prompt after running a campaign for a company targeting local businesses and we wanted to help them with getting placed in major media publications. 

We used this Claygent to find data that we could then feed into the outbound campaign. 

If we found their case studies or past customers, we would call out the success in our first line. 

So we could say something like 

""looks like {{case study customer name}} had great success working with your team to {{under 7 word summary of what they did together}}. Have you thought about showcasing this success in media like {{name drop media company based on industry and location}}. 

If we found media, we would ask how that has helped their business and if they would want to do more of it. 

So we could say something like

""looks like {{company name cleaned by AI}} was featured in {{Publication}}. Would you be looking for other opportunities to showcase your company like you've done in the past?

If we found product names, we would gather more information about the products so we can ask them about featuring them in relevant media. 

So we could say something like 

""looks like you're helping {{2-3 words about people/companies they help}} {{3-4 words about how they help}}. Are you looking for ways to showcase {{product name}} in your target customer's favorite digital and print media? 

This Claygent works very well when you can tie the case study/media/product to how can help them and with 4o mini, it's very cheap to do this research at scale. 

We automated this after we found that our customer's best SDR manually does this kind of research before reaching out to companies. We then found the data and trained the final output on the rep's actually good performing emails. 

So keep in mind, the best AI workflow for your outbound campaigns is the one that empowers you to do things that you would be doing manually but can now scale with AI.

urn:li:activity:7242608402147811328,"This week I had a call with a customer that confirmed our Clay/AI generated emails are getting better responses than their SDR team manually sending emails. This is what we are planning for the rest of the year so both teams work efficiently. 

1) Building a data pipeline so the SDRs focus their time on the best fit accounts. 

I don't think the SDR function is going to be replaced. It's just changing. They found that their team is much more efficient working on the phone and selling on LinkedIn when we are taking care of sending emails. 

We are going to build a trigger waterfall to send accounts to them every month that they should stay focused on. This is powered by Clay and their Salesforce integration. 

Their trigger waterfall works in order of prospect has history of working at current customer -> fundraising -> new hire -> open role -> competitor technology mentions -> Ai generated analysis of website and fit to their offer. 

What we will do for them is any company that has any 3 of those triggers above to be true, we will send those accounts to their SDRs. 

If any 2 or even just 1 of those triggers are true, we will hanlde the outreach. In all of our campaigns, the best copywriting we used is trained on the company's value proposition and we use AI to output a line about how it would apply specifically to that company. 

I post about that line all the time because it's for sure my favorite. 

2) We are doubling down on things that are working on email but taking advantage of the savings of gpt-4o mini. 

This customer really benefits from some research being done on each company website that is never in the same place. When we first started working together, we could get the data but it was so expensive with GPT-4, we could only run small batches. 

We did some testing with 4o-mini and it's been great. 

3) We are going to do some more experimentation with lists and AI analysis. 

There's still some triggers we haven't tried yet like company news featuring keywords, lookalike campaigns, and seeing sending the CEO versus their usual buyer would get an executive buy in better than our title ICP responding.

With o1 coming out, I'm curious if there's more interesting analysis to be done there on the company website information we are pulling as well.

urn:li:activity:7242174291742478337,"I did a article with Leslie Venetz, =% Tom Slocum, William Padilla and the ZoomInfo team about using signals in your outbound. Here's my biggest takeaway for you. 

Data is becoming easier and easier to get your hands on.

When I first started outbound in 2019, I would email people with a {{first_name}} variable and people thought I manually sent them an email 1-1. 

Today, we wouldn't send an email ever without way more information than that. 

Signals has also become table stakes. The biggest mistake I see people doing with signals is not tying what the signal means for your outreach. 

Instead of saying ""saw you're hiring for a {{job title}}""

Talk about what in the job description is important to tie to your offerings.

Instead of saying ""BuiltWith told me you have a history of using Salesforce""

urn:li:activity:7241819440240078848,"Here are my most used Google Search Operators to find data that powers our outbound campaigns. I find myself using the same 3 over and over. 

If you don't know what a Google Search Operator is, it's just a way for you to refine your Google Searches, but there's a lot of business use cases for them particularly for outbound. 

Let's say you wanted to build a list of instagram profiles with emails but you are not allowed to scrape Instagram behind the login. You can use Google Searches to do this. 

if you search site:instagram.com (""content creator"" OR ""influencer"") AND (""@gmail.com"" OR ""@yahoo.com"" OR ""@hotmail.com"")

This search also happens to be an example of a search with all my favorite operators. 

1. site: operator

This operator tells Google, ""hey I want all search results that only come from this website"" 

Want to see if Rippling has a privacy policy? Search site:rippling.com privacy policy and only search results from Rippling will appear. 

2. """" 

Quotes as an operator force the google search to only show results when that exact string exists on the page. We can combine this and the site: operator to do research on company's offerings and focuses at scale. 

Does Genova Burns law firm work with wrongful termination?

site:genovaburns.com ""wrongful termination"" 

This search holds the answers.

3. Boolean searches like AND or OR

You can use these to force the search to contain ANY of your searches or it must contain both. searching for Influencer AND content creator will force the google search to find people that claim to be both. Searching for Influencer OR Content Creator will open up your search. 

Others that I use for instance are 

inurl: which searches for a keyword being in the URL

*: which acts as a wild card variable and can stand for anything

(): which helps group search terms together like I did above

But I find that the three I went in depth on I use more than any others.

Clay being the new kid on the block has a lot of people thinking it's too expensive. We use Clay for every campaign we launch at Growth Engine X and here's how we keep costs down. 

The three musketeers of scaled data scraping for me are right below.

1. ZenRows
2. Claygent
3. Serper

Here's how we think about using each. 

Zenrows - they have proxy networks to get around anti scraping technologies and a function to automatically organize the data. FANTASTIC for scraping programmatic SEO pages with great data on them. 

Pros - super cheap, great for getting data that's in the same spot on a website every time, great for getting multiple data points from a website in one run. 

Cons - it does get blocked by some websites, if you're not using Clay you need to be a bit technical. Sometimes the autoparse doesn't work but you can just do a keyword match most of the time. 

Claygent - yes this is in Clay but you power it with your Open AI key. With 4o mini, it does a great job and it's super cheap. This is great for finding data from pages that aren't in the same place every time. Think if you want to find the pricing of a SaaS company. Claygent is great for finding this and otherwise structuring unstructured data. 

Pros - very cheap with gpt-4o mini, great for getting data that's publicly listed but not organized in any way. 

Cons - sometimes it hallucinates just a bit and you need to make sure that your output comes from the source you expect. Don't give it more than 1 research task at a time.

Serper - this is a google search scraper that is really reliable without breaking the bank. This is great for finding information when you need just one data point and you don't have a link to point anything at. 

Google built the largest scraper in the world and now it's time for the people they built it off of to be able to get access to that data. Serper does that. 

With Zenrows, you need to have the link of what you want to scrape so Zenrows can go do it's thing. We will often use Serper in place of Zenrows if we just need one data point from the page OR if we need to find the link that the data is listed on. 

Pros - get access to all the data google has

Cons - gets usually one piece of data back, you need to know how google search operators work, and even for how cheap it is, zenrows and claygent are cheaper.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241521239624679427,,9 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,1.0,,,,,True,Yes,Yes,Yes
urn:li:activity:7241445357828587521,"If you sell to companies with brick and mortar locations, a good way to stand out in your campaign is to name drop the nearest case study you have to their location. AI models make this task much much easier than it used to be. 

If you only have 1-10 local businesses you would want to name drop depending on location, doing a simple if/then statement in google sheets would be good enough. 

If you have more than that, AI can really speed things up because it knows the distance between locations extremely well. 

We've helped companies from local gutter cleaning service to venture backed SaaS companies implement this approach and it's worked across the board. 

The local business owners have a great sense of who their local competition is. In contrast, there are probably hundreds of outbound marketing agencies in New Jersey that I've never heard of. So this approach definitely has an ICP it works better on. 

That being said, here's how we implement it. 

Step 1: Get a list of your case studies and their location and normalize the data. All you need is company name and address. I like to get the Zip Code to be it's own column as that's a great place to do a lookup. 

Step 2: Upload your list to an AI prompt. Here's an example of a prompt that we use. 

""I'm going to give you an input of an address that is someone I'm going to reach out to. I'm also going to give you a list of my current customers and their address. Think slowly and critically about which location is the closest to my input. In the output, only give me the company name that is the closest to my input address.

This is my input address: {{input}}

this is a list of my customers:

{{customer name example}} : {{Customer address example}}
{{customer name example}} : {{Customer address example}}
{{customer name example}} : {{Customer address example}}
{{customer name example}} : {{Customer address example}}
etc. 

""""""""

Think slowly about which location is the closest to my input and only output the company name closest to my input. Please take your time to do this task correctly because my job is dependent on this being done correctly and I need you to get this right. 

Step 2: In Clay we give examples that we manually research and write so that AI knows what we are looking for from a formatting and research stand point. 

Step 3: We run it and see if there are any other edits we should make and if everything looks good, we get everything ready for sending. 

You can make this even better by having a lookup that if the company name in the output = a company name in another table, you can even bring in a custom case study about that company to make it even more relevant. 

I almost didn't post about this idea because of how niche it is but decided to in case it helps someone think of using AI in a similar way with a different use case in their outbound campaigns!",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241445357828587521,,9 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,1.0,,,,,True,Yes,No,No

3. Reducing the email sequence length and focusing on talking to more people vs. following up over and over again. Personally, I prefer to talk to more people than sending 7 emails in a sequence because if they weren't interested the first 3 times, I don't really think they will be the 7th time. 

UNLESS they've had enough time for something to change in their business. Which is fine. When Jan uses the whole list we talked about today he can just restart and the prospects that didn't respond would have forgotten about him.

urn:li:activity:7240041904044748802,"This is the email enrichment workflow we use to send over 1.7M cold emails per month. This is all baked into a Clay template so that my team can duplicate it every time we launch a new campaign. 

We basically have a 2 step process. 

1. We pull most of our contact lists from Apollo. 

Reasoning: They have a very good contact database that combines some great filters that we can use to build our lists. If we need a more custom company list than Apollo can provide, we pull the list from something like Ocean.io, upload the domains to apollo and find contacts there. 

The other reason we do this is because many email finders work by finding permutations of a name against a domain. But an example of a company that won't work for is slack. Their main domain is slack(.)com but their emails are at slackhq(.)com. Apollo has many of these resolved for you. 

2. We upload to Clay and run this workflow in this order.

Validate apollo email with debounce

Anything that wasn't validated we use Prospeo to find more emails. 

Validate with Debounce

Anything we don't find, we use Icypeas and LeadMagic due to their low cost high accuracy enrichments. 

Validate with Debounce

I've found that checking more than 3 providers really only increases our tech spend and maybe increases the list by a couple percentages here and there. 

Note: Erol Toker has an email finding tool that I've found to be extremely accurate that just hasn't made it into our workflow just yet but I wanted to shout it out. 

Now Clay takes care of all the email finding for us so we can merge all of the emails into one column. If an email does not exist in that column, we also make a conditional formula to not run any other enrichments because if we don't have an email, why waste money if we can't send an email. 

You'll also notice we use debounce even though these tools verify their emails. I love them all for that but I usually see bounce rates go up if we don't use debounce and in this current email deliverability climate, we have to be as strict as possible. 

Debounce also isn't taking new customers so I've heard people have good success with tools like Million Verifier and Clearout as well!

When we have a list that we NEED an email for as many people as we can, we will run the full Clay waterfall to put as many shots on goal as we can. And why not? They only charge when an email is found.

Perhaps the only edit I make to the waterfall is that if a catch all domain is found by two providers, I write my own formula so it doesn't keep trying to run the waterfall since the domain is catchall.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7240041904044748802,,9 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,1.0,,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes

Their selling proposition was that they knew how to increase the digital presence of a financial advisor in their local market. It was a done for you service on the front end and then after a month the advisors would put in their own effort with the company's guidance. 

They were sending emails with case studies and the normal best practices of emails and Clay added fuel to the fire. 

We created a workflow where we would automate a google search about the financial advisor using Serper. We used Serper so that we could get that top 10 searches if we searched 

{{Advisor Name}} {{city}} {{company name}}

A search that they should absolutely come up for. 

And then depending on what we found, we changed our first line. 

If we couldn't find anything about them in the top 10 searches on google (no instagram, facebook, linkedin, etc) we would message about that.

If we only found 2 or 3 things we changed the message.

If we found a lot of great social presence we changed the message again. 

All of this was done with just a Serper search and free filters in Clay so it was really cheap. We would even screenshot the google search to prove to them that we did our research.

If you don't know what Claygent is, Claygent is an AI connected to the internet built by Clay and mastermind Adam Eldefrawy. 

I often tell customers that the way they should be using AI is to think about what would they research about a company manually before they reach out and think how they can find that automatically. 

Keeping the end in mind is the key. 

Claygent was always great with GPT-4 and 4o but the cost was tough to run on every campaign. 

With 4o mini, we are seeing Claygent run for as low as .0001 depending on how difficult the task is. I've tried really really hard to get it to go over .03 because that's what many data providers are charging anyway and I can't do it. Sometimes I can't even get it above .01 if I overprompt things.

Most data providers are getting their data by scraping structured data and now Claygent can grab that data AND the data that is unstructured for much less than many of these providers charge for. 

My only exception to this is if we can find the SEO page that has the data and we can find the link easily (think Crunchbase, Craft, and similarweb pages) we will scrape that with ZenRows because it's so cheap and it's great to just get all the data in a structured way. 

Here's a list of things we have used Claygent to research for us in the past. 

- Finding if an ecommerce brand has a sustainability mission and what that mission is.
- Finding competitors of companies by checking multiple sources.
- Finding what the most luxury upsell a hotel had listed on the site to be able to drop in our outreach.
- Estimating the Average Order Value of an ecommerce store
- Finding reviews about products on an ecommerce store
- Classifying companies by sub industries by looking at their website
- Finding case studies listed on a site
- Check if a marketing agency runs reddit ads for their customers
- Finding company news, fundraising information etc
- Finding companies that mention Brands that are not on the brand website
- Finding how many units are under management for a property management firm.
- Finding when a contact has appeared in someone else's blog or podcast
- Taking a contact's past experience and finding company news about one of their past best jobs
- Finding people making complaints online about a product so the team could fix it
- Checking what kind of companies a VC/PE fund invests in
- Finding the kind of equipment/machinery a company sells so that we can make a guess on what kind of calibration services and licenses they pay for
- check what kind of legal services a law firm provides

One of the first campaigns we launch is a lookalike campaign. 

I think this is a perfect campaign to start with because you have less guessing around the message. There was some tangible outcome you created for a customer that made them so excited they agreed to be a case study. 

No beating around the bush guessing what people might find interesting about your offer. You can go to companies that look similar to your case study and just preach how you helped them. 

Ocean has such an easy to use lookalike filter and great keyword filters on top that make it so easy to work with. 

You definitely need to use your keyword filters because the system might find a company is a lookalike for a different reason than you intended. Or you can add more companies to the lookalike list to have a better base to go off of. 

Then we send an email using Clay for our first line.

The template looks like this. 

Hey {{First_name}}, I saw on your website you help {{ai generation of what they do}} which is similar to what a current customer of ours, {{Insert Name}}, does and I wanted to connect. 

{{Insert how you can help}}

{{Insert the proof that you have from working with the case study company}}

Just had a call with a customer where we were getting a good lead flow but many leads weren't great because they are just generally interested but not ready to take action right away. 

Here's two things we have been trying and seeing some good traction in the last weeks. 

Many people (including us) are using light CTAs like, would this be interesting? or would you like more information? in order to not put too much friction on the CTA. 

For campaigns that you're just getting started with, this is a good place to start. But what if you're getting too many leads that are not qualified because of reasons that you can't publicly be able to research for before you reach out?

Two suggestions we make to our customers for their strategy.

1) Add friction to the CTA

Ask the prospect to send over more information about their situation before booking a call. Make it just a little bit harder to book a meeting than just saying Yes. 

Doesn't have to be a book report. Even just a simple ask like asking what their current Facebook Ad CAC is could be enough.

2) Change your CTA to call out the right kind of person and let the prospect sort themselves. 

Asking ""do you want to sell your business?"" vs. ""If you're doing $2-$5M in EBITDA per year and looking to sell in the next 6 months, let's chat.""

We've been doing outbound on behalf of Instantly.ai for over a year. We tried all kinds of campaigns. Split testing different offers, audiences, messaging, triggers, everything. 

The best campaign we found uses Clay to create outbound ideas for the company we are reaching out that is completely custom to their offer. (check out the video I'll link in the comments on how we do it).

In a year, nothing has been able to beat this campaign. 

Except using Instantly.ai to grow Instantly.

They released their own version of a website visitor identification tool and the first thing we did was test the data to see if it would improve our already winning campaign. 

It tripled the positive response rates without changing any of the copywriting. 

These days, it's such low hanging fruit to target your website visitors, getting a platform that has good match rates is all you need to start converting more of those people that visit the site. 

Kudos to the team for the investment on this product as it's one of the few data platforms I have 0 understanding how they get the data. 

Try it out for yourself. I recommend not telling anyone that you found them on your website and just send your best email as if they were in a regular sequence.

urn:li:activity:7236847947844358144,"Here's a Clay generated AI sentence that 3x'd our positive response rates for a SaaS company selling to a very niche industry. 

We started sending this line in email 2 as a follow up but it was working so well we moved it into email 1 and it performed even better. 

All we did was use AI to create a comparison between what the company we were reaching out to does and how my customer helps people.

So basically each line would look something like 

Hey {{First_name}}, I was on the site and saw how you help people save time with {{X}} like how we can help you save time with {{Y}} so I wanted to get connected.

X in this case outlines how the company helps their customers and Y talks about how we can help them. 

The way we create the line is we use Clay and train a prompt on how we can help a company. Every company comes down to 5 main offers.

Help people save time, save money, make more money, live longer, or increase their social status. 

For B2B, we are mainly concerned with the first 3 so we train the AI on how our company or our customer's company helps people in those 3 ways. So when AI evaluates that company, we can write a line about how we both help people save time or we both help people make more money etc. 

Then we manually write lines to train the AI on how we can specifically help them. This is the most crucial part of the line. The beginning is just a parlor trick but this part will really stick out our relevance to their company. 

We want to train AI to be able to apply what we do as a company to the sentence but we have to do it manually so that it gets as specific as we are looking for. 

This workflow has been in the campaign in email 1 for 6 months and nothing else has beaten it. Although, I think this workflow works well in this context because we aren't targeting people that get a ton of cold email usually so perhaps it's a tactic they haven't seen before.

urn:li:activity:7236809425305382912,"We usually turn off sending for bank holidays but yesterday I wanted to see what the responses would be like. Here's some high level things we saw which you should only take as anecdotal evidence. 

We kept our email volume the same and we have customers targeting everything from HR leaders, founders, ceos, sales leaders, marketing leaders, engineering leaders, operations leaders, etc. Even a company targeting DJs. 

I just took a look at the responses we got yesterday and 90% of them were from the Founder of the company or a person with a c-suite level title. 

Most other target audiences were down for us yesterday. Here's some quick numbers

Customer targeting Founders/C-level folks that on a normal day gets anywhere from 15-20 leads. 10 leads yesterday

Customer targeting DJs gets about 40 leads per day. They got 15 yesterday. 

Customer targeting ecommerce founders gets about a lead or two per day. 0 yesterday.

Customer targeting HR leaders getting about a lead per day didn't get anything yesterday. Even negative responses. Just all out of office. 

SaaS company targeting sales leaders literally got 25 leads on Thursday and got 8 yesterday. 

This is purely anecdotal but I think if you are targeting contacts that aren't founders taking the day off on holidays is not only fine, but probably a good practice.

Targeting Founders or people with c-level titles is probably good to go on holidays. 

Like I said, keep in mind this is purely anecdotal.

urn:li:activity:7236431297215180800,"Contingent staffing and recruiting offers is one of the offers that we say no to anytime we get a waitlist sign up to work with Growth Engine X. Here's why and what we tell them to do instead. 

The reason we say no to these kinds of campaigns is that, for the most part, every person running outbound campaigns for contingent staffing and recruiting are all sending the same email.

This means that even with the best email you send at scale, the increase in complexity won't increase responses remarkably. 

This being said, we have three campaigns I suggest to these kinds of companies. I just think their ROI is better if they run it themselves. 

The first campaign that we run is the most obvious, where we are just looking for people who have open jobs postings. Clay, PredictLeads, Apify, and Jordan Crawford has this data. 

It's the same campaign everyone else is running but we use AI on the job description to be able to make specific call outs that relate to why our candidates are the best. 

You can use Clay and gpt-4o mini to analyze the job description to find the points that make your candidates the best fit to modulate your email for each company.

Simple campaign that you should just be running as a staffing company. Points for filtering open roles that have been open for over 45 days and change your message for that. 

The second type of campaign that we run is we are looking for companies that have signals that they are growing, but they might not be advertising hiring.

We'll look for companies that are having a huge increase in web traffic, LinkedIn company followers, Twitter followers, increases of tech on site, overall headcount growth, etc. Just anything to let us know they are growing even though they might not have job ads. (I've hired every person at GEX without posting a job on a job board for instance). 

And then the third type of campaign I really like to run is one where we find people who recently left their previous company and we can infer that the position needs to be filled. 

And so then we can say, ""Hey, I noticed that Max just previously left the company and moved on to a different company.

How are you thinking about filling that role?""

This is all to be said when you want to do much more generic outreach.

The best campaigns that we've ever found is when you match a candidate to a job opening and the credentials match the job description exceptionally well. 

So these campaigns are made when you don't have that perfect fit candidate ready to go, but we've never seen anything beat the perfect fit candidate outreach when doing cold outbound campaigns for staffing and recruiting companies.

So please keep that in mind if you're doing this kind of outreach.

Even worse, that big ""Report Spam"" button looms with zero friction.

urn:li:ugcPost:7233867834097909761,"How to target contacts with a history of working at your current customers with Clay. 

Even if the contact was not actually working at the company when your solution was implemented, this data workflow is still a great way to connect the dots for prospects in a way that adds social proof to your offering. 

So you can say something like 

""Hey, I see you are at HubSpot now and in the past you worked at Salesforce. Salesforce is actually one of our current customers and we are helping them with {{how you help}}.

Would it be useful to see how we might do the same for HubSpot?""

The problem is, most data platforms do not allow you to pull lists of past company experience and compare to your current lists. 

So we built the workflow in Clay so that it can be added to any workflow you are currently running. Video below but here's the step by step. 

1) Upload a list of your current customers into a Clay table. Clean the linkedin company urls so that you have a nice clean slug like growth-engine-x to do a lookup off of.

2) Upload your lists of prospects. Filter their past experience to find experiences that are not at their current company AND are not current. 

Use the Ai formula generator to get all of their experience in one cell. 

3) Do a lookup from the company table to the people table. 

Voila - a filterable, actionable list of prospects that have a history of working at your current customers. 

You can get even spicier and use Clay to find the dates they worked there so you can line it up but it'll reduce your list size a ton. 

Here's the video explanation for those that want to see it in action.

From just a website input, we are able to launch an outbound campaign completely automatically. 

It creates 3 versions of value proposition messaging and two versions of a completed campaign. 1 with AI and 1 without. 

It uses Claygent and ZenRows to scrape the website for all of the necessary information about the target job titles, target companies, and to create messaging. 

It pushes all of the information into two of my favorite templates. 

We tried it for one of our best customers, one of our average customers, and a customer we are still struggling to crack a campaign for and it's getting the same amount of interested responses per leads contacted as the regular campaigns.

When people ask me  
 
""What's something crazy other people are doing?"" 
 
""How should we be using AI?"" 
 
""What's your top converting prompt?"" 
 
Etc.  
 
All of these questions are well intentioned but they miss the point of why you use AI.  
 
It's to scale the same message you would send if you were to manually research a company and send an email.  
 
Which for every person should be very different.  
 
I've got companies 
 
- scraping soundcloud pages for when listeners like the song the most and we make a comment about that time stamp in the script. 
- using Claygent to find the phone number of the website and the hours they offer phone support and make a comment on that. 
- scraping Facebook Ads and Google ads and depending on how much they are running we change the message 
- finding the page of a brand where they talk about their sustainability goals and we screenshot the page 
- finding the web traffic from similar web, scraping the products from google shopping and making a comment based on the AOV. 
- evaluating job descriptions and matching the needs in the job description to a person on their platform.  
- literally scraping the top restaurant in the area and putting it in the P.S. line of the email and people love it for some reason.  
 
All of these are so specific, I could release the prompts to all of these and they would be worthless to everyone except their competitors. (Even the restaurant thing. That only works to local business owners who don't receive sophisticated emails.)

This is a question I ask customers often times when we onboard them because it helps us understand what direction we should be taking the campaigns in.  
 
From as far as I can tell, I think outbound campaigns can break into somewhat of three buckets.  
 
1. Sharing your offer and proof then trying to book a meeting directly. (I've only seen one offer ever that was so great it closed revenue automatically over email). 
 
2. Sharing some kind of lead magnet or insight to begin a conversation with a prospect.  
 
3. Using cold email for awareness activities to get people to join communities, webinars, etc. (Probably the worst use case for just outbound but better than nothing if you can't get other channels to work). 
 
Everyone wants to jump right into number 1. But often times, their buyers are not in market at all for various reasons of course.  
 
We use this to help tailor the campaigns and how we start. If you have an offer that not everyone is ready to buy, here's what's worked for us.  
 
- Offering to audit what they are currently doing to see if we can help even for free.  
 
- Usually our customers have some knowledge about the market that you can't just read about so we will share insights like those.  
 
- Most commonly and importantly, we will break the offer down into it's individual features and benefits and see if people care about any of them as a stand alone before we talk about a full implementation.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7229111457802588160,,10 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,,,,,True,No,No,No

""Why should I care about Clay? It looks like too many extra steps and I'm already getting responses.""  
 
On even the most basic plans Clay can automate tasks that you have to do no matter what and with Clay, at minimum you are buying back your time.  
 
Email validation is my most prime example.  
 
I used to spend 30-45 minutes waiting for email validation to run on lists over 5000 people. Everyone probably knows the pain of downloading a lead list from a provider.  
 
Taking that CSV and uploading it to an email validation platform platform. Waiting however long to get your list back  and then you can finally upload to your sending platform.  
 
Buy back your time for just the mid tier plan and keep your campaigns full by just uploading a list and walking away.  
 
This is true still for cleaning names, company names, routing leads to campaigns based on different company headcounts, title, seniority, etc.

As many people might know, you have a couple of options to monitor for news for free. 
 
RSS feeds, Google Alerts, and data tools that watch for company news exists as well. Predict Leads is amazing for this.  
 
Sometimes though, you're looking for signals that have some ambiguity to them.  
 
Maybe you want to watch techchrunch for recent fundraising rounds but only of companies that are in the healthcare space.  
 
Maybe you want to watch every news site for any company that had reported a ransomware attack.  
 
Maybe you want to monitor Indeed specifically for new posts Amazon entering into a bulk hiring spree.  
 
We've found that Feedly does a lot of this very well.  
 
You can use their regular tool to create a feed of news stories that you want to look for keyword mentions on OR you can use their Feedly AI to find those stories you want to watch and have it analyze if it's actually what you're looking for.  
 
All the information can be sent into a webhook to power the next step of an automated or manual workflow.  
 
If you need to monitor for large industry trends, custom company news announcements, or other hard to target by just keyword news, Feedly works great.

Just do a quick search for Google search operators and youll see what I mean. 

Google searches help do automated research on companies but then also help us get consensus on data points as well. 

Does a law firm handle wrongful termination suits? Automate a google search with site:{{domain.com}} wrongful termination and find out. 

Whats the average order value of an e-commerce brand? Scrape google shopping and either use a formula to do the math or ask AI. 

Do employees complain about compensation at a company in Glassdoor? Automate a Google search. 

Whats the revenue of a company? You could ask Google and get answers from the best data providers in the business. Or get the first 10 results and ask AI to find an average. 

You can find recent news about a company and filter out news coming from their website or only include that news. 

You can automate searches to see where companies rank for keywords (or dont rank) and make a comment on that. 

You can automatically tell if a company is running Google ads. 

You can see if a prospect has appeared on podcast. Or just see what comes up in the top 10 results when you google their name. (I think my high school track times are still there.)

I'm the first person to tell people that we are expensive and if I don't think we are a fit, I'll tell them why and what they should do instead. 

Here's how each call went. 

Call Number 1

Tried 3 agencies before, mixed results but nothing was outstanding. Often times, other agencies are people who are also trying to do the best for their customers. There are people that are out there that don't try of course but for the most part, I think everyone is trying their best. 

If you went through 3 different agencies, I don't want to be the 4th. I suggested we would supply them with a free list of their ICP and validated emails and they should do some internal tests around messaging before talking to another agency. 

Call Number 2

The company we were talking to has an offer I've already tried and failed with in the past. We tried 12 different angles and nothing stuck. 

I shared what we did in the past and everything I didn't have a chance to try. Hopefully they can try on their own. In these situations, it's also great to work with a company like Leadbird | Get B2B Leads On Demand where they run lower cost campaigns and you can take some more shots on goal. Their might be something internally that they know about their customer that we didn't try for that last company but still, I don't want to lie and say it was all sunshine and rainbows. 

Definitely would try using website visitor identification softwares to try to increase the amount of leads they are getting generally. 

Call Number 3

Target market has 6000 companies in it. After you take into consideration email validation, we might be looking at a list with 6,000-15,000 people on it. Not really enough to figure out what's working, then make a decision, then iterate on campaigns, and then scale. When your target market is this small. Hand to hand combat in emails is better than trying to scale. 

I offered to pull this list for them for free as well. 

Call Number 4

Has a great SDR team already getting them good results. They just needed more inboxes. 

Honestly, Instantly.ai just set up a way to create google inboxes completely automatically and warm them. When people come to us for JUST email deliverability help, there's not a whole lot we would add on top of setting up new real google inboxes.

You're going to need an Apify and a Serper account. We do the whole workflow in Clay but if you don't have an account, you can still get this all done with an app script in Google Sheets. 

Step 1: Generate your list of target companies. You're going to need at minimum the company domain. Really you need their Facebook URL which you can get from the company domain. 

So if the data provider you are using includes Facebook URLs, great. If they don't, you'll need to scrape the domain to find the social links. 

Step 1a: if the provider you used didn't have the Facebook Urls, use ZenRows to get the Facebook Urls from each website.

Step 2: load that list into Apify Facebook Library scraper. Pick the one that is supported by the Apify team so you don't have to pray that user:codingninja69 is online to support you. 

Step 3: Download the list and get ready to run your Serper enrichment. 

NOTE: you will have a big drop off in your list just because most companies aren't actually running Facebook Ads, this is normal. 

Use Clay to run Serper to check if each company is running paid ads on Google. Change the Serper API to output Paid searches. Input the company name as the search as most companies are running ads on their branded keywords. 

If you can spare the expense, use AI to come up with another couple of keywords and run the Serper Google Scrape 2 or 3 more times to get as much coverage on paid keywords as you can get. 

If you aren't using Clay, use ChatGPT to build a Google Sheet app script that will integrate Serper as a formula into your sheet.

Now you'll be left with your list of companies that are running Facebook Ads and NOT google ads.

urn:li:ugcPost:7221642084137472000,"4o-mini is so cheap, you can score every company for a proper fit before doing any outreach and the cost is around .00003 per API call. 

I think we all know the feeling that some data providers don't give us enough to filter by. But this really isn't the data provider's fault at all. 

Many times they are working off of data that is self reported people they are scraping data from.

Also, what makes a company a good fit for you might not be the same criteria for someone else. They can't niche down as far as you want them to. 

But now with 4o-mini being so cheap, you can build your own model and have AI review if the company is a good fit for you to reach out to by yourself. 

Step 1: collect all of the data about a company you use to manually make a decision. Industry, website content, employee headcount, headquarters. Whatever it is.

Step 2: Tell AI what you do and what makes someone a good customer for you. Also include what makes someone a BAD customer for you as well. 

Step 3: Add in real examples to your training that you manually reviewed so that it has something to work with. 

Step 4: run on a list of about 100 companies and further tweak from there. 

Hopefully this helps someone stop sending emails to every company in the ""Computer Software"" industry hoping they are emailing SaaS companies only. 

Think of all the software development or consulting firms you're spamming.

We actually use ClickUp for all of our project management so everything starts with filling in an onboarding form there. 

Then we push their website (and just their website) to a Clay table. 

This table then

- Scrapes their home page with ZenRows

- Finds their case studies with Claygent

- Uses this data to then find what headcount range, what industries, what job titles, and what company keywords come up most often in case studies. OR what would these likely be based on the website content. 

- We create 3 versions of offer style messaging

""If we could help you accomplish (X) in (Y) without (Z) would that be interesting?""

This is not the final messaging we output for clients, it just gets us started and ready for some brainstorming. 

- Finally this all culminates with creating an Apollo link looking up their target titles, headcount, and company industries/keywords.

1) bring in your API keys for just $350 per month and never pay for a clay credit ever making Clay your b2b operating system 

2) I have plenty of customers where Clay generated campaigns show obvious increases in response rates. ¡Felipe Aranguiz sees a 5x increase with an AI generated campaign vs. the next best campaign that uses a traditional trigger like new in role. Gabor Soters campaign only get responses because of the AI and the prospects tell us that. I could go on more if anyone wants more proof. Actually Ill link our 2023 wrapped document in the comments. 

Ill share interested response rates 

3) even if those email data numbers are accurate, its not Clays data. Its the data providers data. (Which by default gets validated by zero bounce) so who holds the responsibility exactly there? 

I send 1.5 million emails per month and dont see those email validation rates or bounce rates youre seeing so curious where that came from.  

Sure if you dont have budget you should just buy discounted inboxes from Instantly.ai, find your leads there and send emails there and youll get responses for a good offer. 

And I dont think Clay is a magic pill that magically increases your responses. Everything of course takes work and you have to find what works best for you. 

But there are for sure tasks that even if youre paying someone $8 per hour the $350 plan will automate for you and easily get you an ROI. (Email validation in row instead of downloading and uploading csvs, lead routing to proper campaigns, once campaigns are set up just add data and close the window, etc)

First, we created the similar web link in Clay as a formula. Every link follows the same pattern and is easy to recreate. It's similarweb(dot)com/website/{{Domain}}

Second, we scraped the page with ZenRows. Now I don't know why but the scrape gets blocked if you use their autoparse so you need to just scrape it for a big blob of text. 

Finally, you get this big blog of text, what are you going to do with it. 

Well the AI formula generator is actually really good at parsing this data out. You just need to find what is the same every time and ask the formula generator to split the text for you.

They just released their upgraded email verification enrichment for catch all/risky email addresses. 

This is huge for a company like them to be doing because they are using their scale to be able to verify the email addresses with real sending instead of an SMTP check or other methods of catch all verification. 

Now users will be able to check if anyone else on the platform has sent an email to the email address you uploaded and see if it went through successfully in the past. 

Allowing you to contact people that usually don't get as many emails because platforms have a tough time with catch all verification. 

We tried to build this based on our own sending data too but it just didn't have the scale necessary to be useful. With the amount of emails Instantly sends on a daily basis, it's incredibly valuable data for those serious about keeping their bounce rates down. 

I don't think this was publicly announced either but I've noticed that if you upload a lead list, they are automatically taking out leads that have a history of bouncing 100% of the time and I haven't even been charged for that.

I built a flow in Clay that takes in just a website as an input. It then finds the LinkedIn company page, scrapes their website for all the home page content using ZenRows and uses Claygent to find some reviews online as well as case studies from their site. 

That way we have a lot of context to work with to generate the new ideas. 

The first steps is to refine the 1000s of characters of text into something usable. 

We use the website, reviews, and case study inputs to create an Ideal Customer Profile doc.

Then we use that data to create a campaign briefing document. This document outputs information about the competitive environment, why people wouldn't buy now, what alternatives are their, what are our value propositions, etc. 

Next, the workflow gets to writing based on all of the collected data. We trigger a ton of individual AI integrations to create value propositions, create offers, and create messaging based on outcomes. 

Finally, we use those inputs to create emails with templates we've already seen work in the past. We're outputting 3-5 per template to just get as many ideas as possible. 

It all sends the data to a google doc so that we can review easily. 

It also generates some follow up messages but so far, we mostly use it internally so that we can see a ton of different ideas before we show customers. One day, I think it'll do the heavy lifting for us end to end, but for now we use it for brainstorming.

urn:li:activity:7220916563221114881,"Played with 4o mini a lot this weekend. Some takeaways as AI is applied to outbound email. 

By far the biggest advantage is cost. It's unbelievably cheap. And it works just like the release notes said. Better than 3.5, not as good as 4o. This post probably won't surprise anyone but here's somethings I tried. 

For reviewing data from tools like PredictLeads and Claygent, it does a great job reducing the information down into custom first lines. 

Also with Claygent, the research Claygent was doing was remarkably better. I have 20 websites that for sure have case studies listed on them. 3.5 found 12. 4o mini found them all. 

I switched out the model from something I've been working on to check if we should even be reaching out to a company and it did ok but not as well as 4o. I think this can be fixed with prompting and more examples as of course the cost is worth the extra effort. 

We've been working on an AI that looks at a list of companies and years and outputs positive news events from those companies at those years. It seemed to accomplish this task just as well as 4o. 

I built an AI to categorize industries for an Enterprise customer that we have. I just switched the model and ran the first 100 rows. It only changed 4 of the outputs. I already manually reviewed the data for accuracy and turned the project over to the customer so the fact that it did that well and is so much cheaper was great. 

Anecdotally, it seems to be better than 3.5 for copywriting but not as great as 4o which is exactly what they said in their release.

Overall, I see this as a huge win for people who build with AI. It's a great model at an even better cost per execution. 

This is going to allow for more tools to train their tech stack on exactly what they would do as a human. The cost would allow for more input in the prompt and more examples for it to reference as well.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7220916563221114881,,11 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes

urn:li:activity:7220057307630505984,"The new GPT-4o mini announcement has gotten me thinking about how such an extreme cost decrease can affect AI written cold emails. 

Of course, AI written lines are going to come down in cost and that's great. (Don't use AI to write your whole email if you haven't been aware). 

With such a big cost decrease, I think the next phase of AI in cold email will be to double check companies for the correct fit line by line before reaching out. 

Traditional methods of filtering don't account for incorrect self reported data. 

For example, many data providers report the industry from the company linkedin profile as their Industry in their database. You know what every 50% or more of software companies reports their industry as? The industry they sell into. 

If you look up companies in a Banking industry, you might still get consultants for banks etc. 

This can be cleared up with tools like Clay  by setting up if/then type workflows or data providers that have manually reviewed data and industry tagging as well as better AI analysis and keyword research like Ocean.io, ZoomInfo, Owler - A Meltwater Offering etc.  

But then this leaves edge cases. Companies that are tough to filter by if/then statements and that are so niche, the standard data providers haven't made filters for them. 

Lists like 

Construction companies with large fleets
Gaming companies with games on every platform

With the models getting cheaper, it's going to be extremely cost effective to build a prompt that checks each company for true fit before you reach out and then you can even send a batch API to get the cost down 50%. 

There can be a review of everything company, every contact, every email before it gets sent out and it would still be cheaper than hiring full time people.

urn:li:activity:7219031784804552705,"Here's a framework that I'm working on for testing campaigns for customers at Growth Engine X to make sure we are covering all of our messaging bases with our customers. 

I believe we are in our Chick-Fil-A era. What I mean by this is we could grow a lot more but I've artificially paused our growth in order to get our processes as straightened out as I can. 

I call it the Chick-Fil-A era because Chick-Fil-A was founded in 1946 and they spent 50 years perfecting a chicken sandwich. 

I despise not knowing if an offer is not made for outbound or if we left a stone unturned and I'm trying to create a process that hits everything we can. 

This is what I'm thinking for overall campaign strategy as far as the CTA or the outcome we want to create in each email. 

I think there are offers that can book meetings just as they are. No lead magnet needed. Just present the offer and those that are interested will respond. 

Then if that doesn't work, a trade needs to be made in order to get a response. It could be some kind of lead magnet or insight. 

Finally, if that isn't working can we ask for feedback from the prospects about why they stick with the status quo and use that for future messaging. 

I think others would benefit by testing in this messaging style as well. 

I also think others would benefit testing these angles as full email sequences as well as within email sequences. 

When it's the full email sequence, each email can be focused on whichever phase of testing you're in. 

When you test everything in one sequence you can 

Make a direct offer in email 1

Try to offer something for free like an insight etc in email 2

Ask for feedback in Email 3

urn:li:ugcPost:7217501187334356992,"80% of cold email knowledge can be learned in 3-4 hours. Maybe less than that. 

Here's a oversimplified guide for people looking to just get started. 

There are three things you need to get right in order to launch a cold email campaign. 

Your email infrastructure, the list you are going to send to, and what you are going to say. The first two are a science; the last is an art. 

Email Infrastructure

If you stick to regular Outlook or Google accounts (right now we are preferring Google with no hard science, just preference) you're going to be pretty set. 

Follow the guide that Instantly.ai or Smartlead have on their websites on setup. OR Instantly will do the Google account set up for you now on their platform and for a dollar less than what Google is charging. 

As someone who manages over 9,000 inboxes there's really no secret sauce to email infrastructure other than following those guides and using a proper warm up network. If your results start decreasing, set up new inboxes and domains, don't mess with trying to save the inboxes. You'll just waste effort and time. 

List Building

Again, another problem that has generally been solved. Couple of rules to look out for. Most list building tools are scraping linkedin, so if your audience isn't on LinkedIn you might have to find a specialty list. You should check any provider against a third party tool (we have been sending to emails Prospeo marks valid for months now and never had a problem). 

Here's a cheat sheet of tools to build lists of companies

Niche industry categorization and Lookalike Audiences: Ocean.io

Ecommerce data - Storeleads

Companies using certain tech - BuiltWith and PredictLeads

Funding Crunchbase and Harmonic (Harmonic also has great industry categorization.)

Local Businesses D7 Lead Finder or Andrew Elsakr

Use Clay to grab unlimited companies as well as people data

ZoomInfo for great intent data and their industry classifications are great too. Most SaaS companies on their list out of everyone I've seen. 

Use tools like Datagma, Prospeo, Findymail to find emails on people or from the websites. 

Copywriting

The art of cold email and the toughest to nail down. 

-Under 100 words (75 is better). Try playing with longer emails after you did short ones. 
- I just made a video on some templates we use on my YouTube. If people want it, I'll link it in the comments. 
- Show your prospect that you can be trusted and that you can create a great outcome. 

Honestly, there's so much to say about copywriting here that this will be oversimplified. 

I post about all of these topics in depth on my YouTube channel. There's a free cold email course and a free Clay course.

If you focus on these 3 areas, there's really nothing stopping you from getting started. What other questions would you have about cold email.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7217501187334356992,,11 months ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,2.0,,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes

For one client, we are testing over 12 versions of copy (it didn't fit in the screenshot) and if we had to upload to all of them manually it would have been a nightmare.

Doing it one time would have been fine but on a weekly basis would have been ridiculous. 

Now with Clay we just use a formula generated with their AI formula generator to output a random number (we input ""if {{first_name}} is not empty, output a random number between 1 and 12"" to get this formula generated.)

If you wanted to even send 25% of your leads to one campaign and 75% of your leads to another campaign, just output a random number between 1 and 4 and run a conditional formula that only leads with 1 in their row go to campaign A and leads with 2, 3, or 4 in their row go to campaign B.

urn:li:activity:7216469208291831808,"A company with a 4 letter website you've all heard of is looking to scale up their outbound and asked me these 3 questions before getting started. 


1. What is the maximum amount of inboxes that can on a domain?

2. Should we send plain text emails or use any kind of tracking?

3. When do you make a decision that a campaign isn't working?

Here's how I responded because I know many other people have these questions. 

Maximum number of mailboxes per domain - this is a black magic thing in cold email. I have no data to support that 2 inboxes is better than 3, but I do see that 10 inboxes is far too many. 

Due to how easy it is to create domains and inboxes. We stick with 2 or 3 inboxes per domain as that's where we see the best results. 

Plaintext vs. sending with tracking links - so the best thing you can do for email deliverability is of course send plain text emails. There's no debate about that. 

But when you're first getting started, I'd use open tracking and never use Click Tracking. The only reason we use open tracking is because when an infrastructure is new, we want to make absolutely sure that the emails are being delivered to the inbox. 

Of course, open rates are an inflated number but if you're getting less than a 20% open rate, you should set up new inboxes and domains to restart the warming process because something is wrong. 

If you don't have that tracking, your actions would be delayed and I like to take care of it as soon as I see it's a problem. 

If you want the best of both worlds you can use Clay to automatically route 25% of your leads to a campaign with open tracking turned on and 75% of your leads to a campaign with open tracking turned off. 

If you use a formula in the AI formula generator like ""if {{first name}} is not empty, output a random number between 1 and 4"", that's how you can randomize. 

Set a conditional formula for the open tracking campaign to only run if the number is 1. Send all other leads to the other campaign. 

How much volume do we send before drawing a conclusion - On average, we see across all of our clients, we need to reach out to 300 people to get a positive response. 

Every industry is different but that's the number we use. That being said, we don't draw even a tiny conclusion until we sent to at least 500 people and I don't draw a full conclusion unless we send to 1000 people. 

Then we change things up.

***Limitations of the test***

Last time we did this, the post went crazy and people critiqued the process. I'll admit the limitations now and be extremely transperant with our process. 

1. the data is sourced originally from people data in Clay and then we use the Clay waterfall to find the data. 
2. We will use responses that have been tagged manually as positive. The reason we do this is because then there's no way an SMTP validation service could screw this up. If an email data tool can't find the email of someone that has passed an email validation service previously AND they positively responded, I don't want it. 
3. Some of these providers have features that include catch all verification. Every email we send at Growth Engine X is validated with Debounce before we send and we only send to Valids. The test will not include the catch all verification. 
4. I could increase the sample size because technically we have 2500 leads to work with but they are over 3 months old and I don't want old data to skew the results. 
5. All of the test data is from the United States, CEOs, at companies under 200. I understand this is a limitation of the test. The industries range from SaaS to laundromats. If you want data outside of the US, I believe > Jacob Tuwiner is working on that. 
6. The results will be displayed by total emails found, total emails that match the email we got a positive response from, and cost per valid email found.

urn:li:activity:7214327033252773888,"I showed a mentor of mine how to double response rates using AI and Clay yesterday. Here's a quick breakdown. 

When you see people saying that AI messaging brings no increase in response rates, when I've dug deeper, it's usually because they are using AI to say something that you wouldn't really say if you were writing the message manually. 

I always ask my customers, if you were to research a prospect manually, what would you be searching for and how would that change the message?

That way we aren't using AI for the sake of AI, we are using it to write as similar of a message to a human as we can. 

In this case, someone who actually got me started in cold email was looking to increase responses for his virtual assistant offer. 

Luckily, I had already made a video on what I would do. 

The TL;DR is that we use AI to look at what that person's role is, what the company does, what are fulfilling parts of that role, and what are most likely tedious tasks in that role. 

We use AI to message them about how they might love certain parts of their role like speaking to successful customers or making new marketing campaigns. Then the AI also talks about tasks that they most likely would want to outsource to a virtual assistant. 

That way instead of sending a Virtual Assistant offer like everyone else, we send a message giving the prospects ideas of tedious tasks they can off load to someone else.

I tell all of our customers that there are three essential parts to an outbound campaign. Email infrastructure, Data, and copywriting. 

Email infrastructure and Data are very much a science and I work incredibly hard to make sure that are fulfillment team is well versed with data products in order to do great work. 

Copywriting is much more an art as we'll get into later.

Our email infrastructure is the same infrastructure that you will find recommended by Smartlead or Instantly.ai so we surely have no secrets there. 

Their data was very interesting. They needed to target brands that are already doing phone support for their customers. Before we did the normal work of finding contacts, we had some data waterfalls to make. 

First we pulled a list from Storeleads. Storeleads does come with a phone number but it isn't always the support phone number so we needed to prove that it was listed on the website. 

First, we used Serper.dev to see if we could find the phone number listed by Storeleads on the site. If we got results back, we knew it was the number publicly listed. If not, we moved on. (The google search operator here was site:{{domain.com}} ""{{Phone Number}}"" OR {{Phone Number}})

The reason we searched for the full phone number in quotes and then without was because storeleads gives the number as 555-555-5555. If that doesn't perfectly match what we searched then it won't come up. So we also searched for the number without quotes in the google search. 

Then we used Clay to make sure that the result snippet had the same last 4 digits because that format would always be the same. 

Second, we used ZenRows to pull down all of the information from the home page that we could and attempt to find a phone number that way. 

Finally, if that didn't work, we used Claygent baked into clay to add some AI search capabilities.

The copywriting was actually the fun part here. One questions we ask people frequently in onboarding is why people book inbound sales calls? what's the problem that they are having? We used those problems in messaging but nothing was sticking. 

It took some more sessions with their team until we found the money maker. After about 11 different scripts we found the messaging that worked and then we scaled it up. 

Much more was accomplished than that $400k deal but it was definitely a great single one to book in for the team!",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213896751668150273,,1 year ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes

If this keeps working well, we will add to a full rotation for clients. 

Lately I've been thinking about cold email copywriting as a set of ""rules"" that we all generally agree on. 

Under 100 words
2-3 word subject line
Light CTA
Etc.

Then 1 by 1, I think of a ""rule"" and how I would break it. 

Why do we have to make emails less than 100 words? 

Well because people don't have time to read a novel. 

But then if what we decide to say doesn't resonate right now, we are out of luck.

So what if we paired a super short message with even more content below the signature so

- they can quickly skim and decide whether or not to respond to our main offer
- if they are on the fence with responding, they can get more information immediately
- it's still short enough that if it really isn't relevant, they can let us know or pass without wasting their time. 

Copy format goes something like this (this is still in testing by the way but we are getting early success so I thought I'd share).

{{First_name}} - {{relevant first line generated with Clay}}

We just helped {{case study}} accomplish {{outcome}} and after reviewing your company I think we could help you as well. 

Specifically, I think we can help {{AI generated idea about how our service could be applied to their company}}.

- Basic table creation
- How to save credits with conditional formulas
- How to manipulate data with formulas
- How to find a list of companies
- How to find a list of people and enrich for emails
- Another example workflow of how to find a list of jobs and then find hiring managers at the company

All to show you that Clay is just as expensive as your other tools if you use their API on the $350 plan which if you consider the time saving just pays for itself.

And Clay is just a spreadsheet connected to other tools. The same process would have to be done if you downloaded a list from Ocean.io, uploaded to Prospeo to find emails, then uploaded that list to find keywords on site using ZenRows. But instead of switching tools it's all in one.

This post really goes out to the Clay team and in particular the cofounders Kareem Amin and Varun Anand who the company could not be where it is today without them. 

My interactions with Kareem has always been amazingly insightful. Whether it's discussing growing a company or philosophy on life and what gives it meaning, Kareem is deeply wise. When problems happen at the company, he shows little emotion and just thinks about how to solve the problems. 

Varun is one of the best operators I've ever seen at a company. Recruiting, Sales, Customer support, marketing, HR, networking, everything. Varun can do it all and he brings those skills to the team. 

Also an insane amount of kudos should be given to the team with their quick ability to launch new features and solve customer problems.

1) We leveraged AI to write custom messages to each prospect about how the solution would be helpful specifically to them. 

This is probably my favorite campaign to start every customer in Growth Engine X on. We train AI on what your company does. Then manually write 3-5 emails to prospects based on what their company does. 

We use that manual email work to train the AI on what to say so that we can always connect the value proposition of the product to what they do as a company. 

2) We used a specific trigger. Every company we reached out to has recently hired a new sales rep AND they have less than 5 sales people on the team. 

All of this work is done in Clay

3) I used a whimsically controversial topic as my subject line. 

This was maybe the best part (the responses sure said so). There is a half joking debate in New Jersey if a particular egg, cheese and meat sandwich is called Taylor Ham or Pork Roll. 

So I made ""Taylor Ham or Pork Roll?"" the subject line and only emailed people in New Jersey. 

Not scalable at all of course but I was just trying to do everything I could to get a response and it paid off. 

We explain the Subject Line in the P.S. line saying ""I know you get emails like this all the time so I wanted to send something that might stand out. I'm from New Jersey too and wanted to know where you stand on the debate."" 

I know it's not relevant but we had so much other relevance, I took the risk. 

Line 1 was naming that new sales rep

Line 2 gave a quick offer

Line 3 Used AI to apply the value proposition to their company

Line 4 Asked for interest

urn:li:activity:7211033169569984512,"Here's how we helped Alex Kurland substitute a 6 figure data provider with the $349 Clay subscription and ZenRows. 

Alex knew exactly the data he wanted. 

Employee headcount 
Headcount Growth 
Fundraise Data
CEO Glassdoor Reviews
Revenue Data
Hiring Data
Web Traffic Data
And some other odds and ends

Their other data provider does a great job but it's really expensive. Here's how we did it. 

Employee Headcount / Headcount Growth- we just used the Clay integrations for this. Nothing exciting. 

Fundraise Data - sometimes one provider doesn't have everything. So we pulled in data from Crunchbase and Owler using our favorite Serper/Zenrows combination.

CEO Glassdoor reviews - we used Clay to make a formula that would pop out the glassdoor url the same way every time as their pages are created with the company name programmatically. We then scraped the page to find the CEO reviews and we even took the revenue data from here too. 

I like getting Revenue data from Glassdoor because it's a self reported number from HR and it would actually hurt them to under report or over report the number. As opposed to the back of the napkin calculations other data companies have to resort to making. 

Hiring Data -- Good old PredictLeads integration in Clay

Web Traffic Data - Similar web makes their url for their public pages the same every time. We just cleaned the domain, made a formula and then outputted the similarweb link for Zenrows to scrape. 

This is an odd one because Zenrows can't parse the data automatically but it can scrape the page generally, so you have to read the output a little to get what you're looking for. 

There was some other data in there that we rolled in from Owler and Crunchbase public pages like their customer types, descriptions, products, news, etc.

urn:li:activity:7209962588162400256,"Here's our waterfall to find contact information for local business owners. Buckle up because it gets a little wild. 

Why do we have to do this? Because local business owners don't often have LinkedIn profiles which is mainly where big data companies get their contact information from. 

Here's how we use Clay to get the data. We want to move from highest likelihood of finding the owner -> just finding any contact information we can. 

1. We use the LinkedIn Integration in Clay to take a shot at finding them on LinkedIn. 

Some business owners will have a linkedin profile and we don't want to rule them out. 

2. We use Claygent to attempt to find a Facebook profile of the owner. Many times they might not have a LinkedIn profile but they have a facebook profile. 

Then we parse out the name and use Prospeo to see if we can get a business email match. 

If that doesn't work we...

2a. We again use Claygent to see if we can find the owner name on the website as well. These steps can be interchangeable if you so choose.  

3. Scrape the website using ZenRows to find any email address we can. We can then use AI to compare against any owner names we potentially found with Claygent and see if we have any likely comparisons. 

4. If we still have not found any emails or no matches, we will use the Prospeo domain email finder to see any other emails that they have listed. Again, using AI to do a very cheap quick match that often you can't do with a strict keyword match

5. If we still have not made a match, we now have a great list of generic and professional email addresses that we collected from Scraping the website or using Prospeo. 

We then reach out to these emails with a different campaign than when we know the owner. 

Another solution we are thinking about adding to this is Firecrawl. dev's LLM extraction to attempt to find the owner name as well. 

Does anyone have any other additions to finding local business owner contact information?",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7209962588162400256,,1 year ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,1.0,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes
urn:li:activity:7209287976806219777,"How you can use Serper and ZenRows to build your own database for ~.001 per row. 

We are going to take advantage of data that is placed publicly on programmatic SEO pages. 

Owler, Craft, Crunchbase, Glassdoor, Indeed, etc all have publicly available information that you can scrape without being logged in. 

With a three step process and no coding skills required by using Clay, you can enrich your leads list with any data you need. 

Step 1: Use Serper to find and target the page you need to scrape. 

Google has built the greatest scraper in the world with their search engine, Serper helps you get access to it programmatically. 

You can use Google Search Operators (I have a YouTube video about them if you don't know how to use them) in order to narrow your Google Search to get the exact results that you need. 

Search operators like 

Site: will return results just from one website

"""" will return exactly what you need

Inurl: will return results from a page with whatever you define has to be in the url. 

So if you want to scrape Owler you can find the page you need by searching 

site:owler.com ""{{company_domain}}""

This will return results with the website on the page. 

Step 2: Scrape the page with Zenrows.

Zenrows does two things really well for scraping. 

1. It has it's own proxy network so that it can beat anti scraping technologies.
2. It automatically parses the data for you so that you don't have to use a crazy Regex formula or an LLM to get the data you need. 

Point the page that you found with Serper to the scraper in ZenRows and you have a match made in heaven. 

Step 3: Use the functions in Clay to format and verify the data and then use it for your outbound campaigns, updating your CRM, spamming your ex. I don't care, just get that data.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7209287976806219777,,1 year ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes
urn:li:activity:7208852803073495041,"What's actually a ""good"" positive response rate on outbound email? As usual it depends. 

Across all of our customers in 2023, we averaged one positive response for every 320 contacts we reached out to.

320 is the number I feel good about and my friend Nick Abraham has said his number is 375 on twitter. 

Quick tangent:

That's just an average. Some customers get 1 positive response for every 10 people they reach out to because they have an amazing lead magnet. 

Some customers get 1 for every 100 contacts because of their offer. 

We are helping a public company that recently IPO'd get one positive response for every 60 leads by using AI to write emails their team aren't even sending manually. (the current team writes every email manually and gets 1 positive response for every 150 leads contacted). 

Some customers get 1 positive response for every 600 people they reach out to but were getting 0 without us. 

Some customers admitted, we have tried over 20 variations of campaigns and the best we get is 1000 leads per positive response. 

It all depends on your offer, market, etc. 

So, how do we use this number to inform our outreach?

If we launch a campaign that we get 1 positive response for every 200 contacts enrolled, we scale the campaign and focus on scale vs. iteration. 

If we launch a campaign that we get 1 positive response for every 1000 emails we send, we pause it and focus on iteration. 

But let's say we launch 10 campaigns and can't crack 1 positive response for every 800 contacts?

Depending on the size of the market, we might scale that campaign to help a client reach their goals. 

This is why I speak in ratios of positive responses to leads contacted because it helps envision what this would look like in your market.

If you have 10,000 total contacts in your market and your ratio is 500:1, you can not and should not scale that campaign as you will run through your market too quickly. 20 leads in a month and then running out of contacts isn't great. 

If you have a market with 100k total contacts and your ratio is 800:1, barring that you have really tried many more experiments offers, lead magnets, etc, you could scale this campaign and still hit reasonable sales goals. 

Of course we all want to get to the point that for every 100 people we reach out to we get a positive response, but this really isn't realistic. 

We use our average positive response per contacts enrolled across all of our customers as a gauge, but each industry is different. 

Selling to enterprise has different averages than selling to local businesses. 

Selling to SaaS founders has different averages than selling to Ecommerce founders. 

Selling to Chief Technology Officers has different averages than Chief Marketing Officers.

We are seeing some inboxes that are set up with the exact same process get through a 2 week warm up and have low open rates and some have high open rates. 

We are also seeing Google and Outlook bounce emails with a 550 error instead of disconnecting and blocking the inbox. 

We are currently lowering our threshold of how many emails we send per day. 

We are also setting up new domains for clients and existing clients on rolling basis. So instead of setting up 20 inboxes in one day, we are spreading out the set up across 2 or 3 days. 

This rolling basis of setting up inboxes seems to be helping a ton right now. 

We are monitoring all campaigns for daily bounce rates as well to stay ahead of any issues we can see. 

Ive anecdotally seen inboxes have low open rates in batches. 

Definitely keep a lookout for what Vaibhav Namburi will have to say about this as hes closer to the data.

urn:li:activity:7206164262719827969,"Revenue is often a metric that customers want thats difficult to get a good estimate on. Here how we do it. 

Each data provider has their own way of getting revenue and its usually some formula based on employee headcount. 

This makes most revenue numbers dubious at best (which I dont blame the data providers for. In my opinion this is an issue with customers expectations of the providers). 

Heres how we find revenue numbers for our customers.  

Upload a list of domains you want to research to your trusty Clay table. 

Connect Serper.dev to your API so you can save Clay credits. 

Create google searches to find Owler, Crunchbase, and ZoomInfo public pages 

Create these searches

Site:crunchbase.com {{targetdomaincom}} revenue

Site:ZoomInfo.com {{targetdomaincom}} revenue

Site:owler.com {{targetdomaincom}} revenue

What youll get is in what is called the Google Snippet, a bunch of revenue numbers. 

Ask AI to analyze the snippets and average together the revenues for your own revenue number based on the best providers. 

Or you can cut to the chase and just do a google search for ZoomInfos revenue number. =
 

Keep in mind, I still think employee headcount is better as a proxy for revenue but if you really want revenue, this is how we like to get it.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7206164262719827969,,1 year ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes

Many of my customers want to be able to target SaaS companies but they don't often self report themselves that way. 

So we pulled over 250k companies that had any shot of being remotely a SaaS company. 

Then we scored each company using Clay and ZenRows to find how often do companies like Owler, Crunchbase, Apollo and ZoomInfo agree that these companies are SaaS companies.

Then we used serper to find keywords that SaaS companies will normally have on their site like ""API"". 

I left the amount of keywords detected in the list so you can filter it for any score that you want. 

Here's the catch though...

There are still many service companies that say they help software companies that have made their way into the list. 

So I'm leaving comments on for this list and going to allow other people to review it with me to see if the community can clean up this list. 

If it starts getting too spammy and unhelpful, I'll shut it down.

urn:li:activity:7203779754527707140,"Here's how you can analyze what products an e-commerce store sells. 

Many of the Clay maximilists on here like to use Claygent for everything which is great. But I often find that Claygent is best used as a last resort when data is truly not capably of being sourced programmatically. 

In my opinion the best way to find products on a site AND confirm if a site is an ecommerce brand is to scrape Google Shopping for results.

You will lose some smaller brands because many of the time they won't have gone through the steps to set up Google Shopping but you most likely don't want to sell to them anyway. 

Large companies that have merch on a shopify store but that isn't their core business will be filtered out as well which is great. 

With the Google shopping result, you can search for a brand by its website in Clay and then filter that search for only results that have the target brand's website in them. 

This removes any confounding data of someone selling a product on Ebay with a similar name but it's not actually from the company.

urn:li:activity:7203430949949194241,"Here's how you can send a screenshot of your prospect's LinkedIn ads when you send them an email. 

This campaign is getting a positive response for every 100 contacts we reach out to on behalf of a big customer of ours. 

Step 1 

Build a list of companies you want to check that are running LinkedIn Ads 

OR 

Scrape the LinkedIn ads library directly

In both situations, you can use Apify to scrape what you are looking for. 

If you build a list of companies you will need to build the LinkedIn ad library links which is easy because they all contain the linkedin company ID

Edit: LinkedIn is shortening this link. Look at it yourself in the ads libary.

If you scrape the LinkedIn ads library directly, you either trust that the link for the Ad CTA goes to the website or you can use Clay to convert company ID numbers to websites. 

Enrich in Clay to filter out bad fit companies as well. 

Step 2

Take a Screenshot of the Ads. Now that you have the advertiser links and maybe you have done some filtering, you can use ZenRows to take a picture of the ad. 

Make sure you wait about 200 milliseconds for the ad to load on the page. 

This is the exact API call I made with my API key redacted. 

Edit: LinkedIn is shortening this link as well. I'll try to put in the comments. 

Step 3

Use an AI model to help you create messaging about the ad or filter for your best fit customers. We are using AI to talk about how the Ad can be applied in other places to help the company market more. 

And that's pretty much it. With just Apify, Clay, and Zenrows you can take a screenshot of your prospects ads and write GPT content that aligns with a comment you would make on the ad if you were to manually review it. 

Easy to use GPT Vision to look for other elements that you want to know is happening as well.

1. Eventbrite, Loom, and Google Forms API Hacks

It used to be possible to bulk invite a list of email addresses to events through eventbrite or send loom videos/google form links to gain attention. That was shut down quickly. 

2. LinkedIn Connection Exploits

LinkedIn used to let you connect with up to 1,000 people per week by leveraging the contact book feature and a script that selected all contacts. The script doesn't work anymore but the contact book feature does. You could just upload a list of personal email addresses and have LinkedIn find the profiles. Still works if you're ok with clicking a ton. 

3. YouTube Ad Hijacking

Targeting specific YouTube videos with ads that mimicked the content used to be a goldmine. People thought they were watching the original video, leading to high engagement. Unfortunately, YouTube stopped this targeting method.

4. Data for SEO
There was a time when you could scrape SimilarWeb data through Data for SEO's API. After a cease and desist, access to the cheap data doesn't work anymore.

5. Bing GPT-4 API Key Exploit

For a brief period, you could access GPT-4 for free using exposed API keys in Bing. It was fun while it lasted, but it was quickly patched.

6. Sell SAS Unlimited API

Unlimited API access to contact data was a dream. However, increased rate limits have made this far less effective.

7. Web Summit Scraping

Scraping attendee lists from Web Summits web app (which they would license for other top events to use. It was a fantastic way to build contacts. Now, with the switch to mobile apps, scraping is much tougher.

8. LinkedIn Event Invites

Sending thousands of LinkedIn event invites per day was once easy to target your ICP. LinkedIn has reduced the bulk capabilities, making it less effective.

9. OpenAI Free Credits

It used to be easy to get $2,500 in free OpenAI credits from their startup program. Now, the program is more selective, making it harder to get those freebies.

10. iMessage Sending via Porterhouse

Cold texting via iMessage had higher response rates due to the blue bubbles. These days, spam sensitivity has made this tactic much riskier.

11. Have I Been Pwned Email Search

You could freely use the Have I Been Pwned API to check for emails. Just programmatically make the most common permutations and hit the API. Now, slower response times and rate limits have diminished its utility.

A couple of months ago, Rohan Jhunjhunwala joined our team and he asked what time he should be working to match with our schedules as he's based in India. 

One of my first jobs was working overnight in college and I really hated what my schedule turned into because of it. 

So especially in our company where work can get done asynchronously for the most part, I told him to not worry about working our time and just work when he was comfortable. 

GEX Night Shift was born and I think we are going to keep doubling down.

urn:li:activity:7199030357436825600,"I often get asked about how to prompt AI to achieve the best results, and I've found that I personally keep going back to the same 4 steps. 

Part 1: Generally instruct AI on what you want it to do

Start by clearly stating what you want to accomplish with the AI. 

For example, ""I want to write a sentence about the mission of this company in under 15 words.""

This just helps AI get it's direction going and is the part I think about the least. 

Part 2: Provide Reference Data

The biggest mistake people make is simply pasting a website URL or a company name and asking AI to write about it. That is a sure fire way to give AI the opportunity to hallucinate complete non sense for you. 

Instead, give it specific data to reference so you know that the information it is making decisions off of is correct (or at least you only have your self to blame if things go wrong.)

Part 3: Refine Your Instructions and constrain it's creativity. 

Be precise about what you want. Specify the word count, keywords to include, and the tone or style. For instance, ""Keep the output under 15 words, use keywords from the input, and write in simple language."" 

This is where you have to remember you are talking to the world's smartest person and they have 0 context on what you need. 

Part 4: Give Examples of what you want the output to look like

Show examples that match the desired output format and style. This helps AI understand the structure youre aiming for. 1 to 2 are usually fine. You can do this in the prompt or using the API to make an overall conversation.

From here, I edit the prompt based on what I see. If the output is too long, I edit part 3 to make it shorter. If it's speaking with language that no one would use I say to speak at 5th grade reading level and don't be overly complimentary. 

Final tip: I've legitimately found an increase in my prompt accuracy when I add a little bit of a guilt trip. Like so,

""Keep in mind, I really need you to get this right, otherwise, I might get fired. Take your time and don't just output the first thing you think of. Think critically about what I'm asking you to do and output text that meets all of my criteria. I am counting on you to get this right.""

By following these steps, you can leverage AI to do a lot of the heavy lifting for you.

urn:li:activity:7197292479866359808,"Quick tips on how to confirm if a company is in your ICP with scraped data or AI. 

You cant just trust what a company self reports their industry to be on LinkedIn. 
If youre targeting tech companies they almost never are categorized correctly.

Heres some examples we do all the time for customers at Growth Engine X 

Find if a company is B2B or B2C - we score the company on a range of 1-10 with a custom prompt that we have. Check if they have SDRs. Check for common B2B tech like Clearbit installed on site. 

Find if a company is an e-commerce store. You cant just trust store leads or the fact they are using Shopify. Use Serper(.)dev to scrape their Google shopping listings to confirm Google allows people to buy products. 

Does a company sell to enterprise companies? Scrape their pricing page for enterprise keywords and check if they have sales reps with enterprise in their title. 

Check if a company has a booking link as a call to action. Use google search operators to search the site with keywords and use Serper again. 

Check if a company gets a certain level of web traffic from certain age groups by scraping similar web with ZenRows

Exportlists(.)io can help you get lists from a variety of sources but their newest feature (which deserves it's own post most likely) is freaking fantastic.

Of course this starts with getting a Clay account fired up. 

This idea definitely has a chicken/egg problem so you could find B2B customers first or influencers first. Im not sure which would work better. 

Lets assume you want to find influencers first. 

1) build a list of influencers by filtering by follower count and keywords on the profile (I dont know of any other platform that lets you do this). 

Generate a list of emails to ask if theyd allow you to try to find them brands to work with. Weve done this in the past for customers targeting Instagram influencers, almost no one says no. 

2) After you have some influencer traction, look at what they talk about and who their audience is. 

Again, you can use Clay here to build a list of brands. Swap in Ocean.io, ZoomInfo, or Harmonic if youd like. 

3) pitch the brands on connecting them with the influencers.

I see people using AI to score if a company is a fit for their services. Lets say if you want to find if a company is a B2B company or B2C. 

The mistake I see most people make is that they ask AI to output B2B or B2C as an answer. 

Instead, ask Ai to give a score from 1-10 on how confident it is that a company is a B2B company vs. B2C. 

Your prompt could look like this. 

Evaluate if this company is a business that sells to other businesses or if they sell directly to consumers. If you are 100% confident that the business is B2B output a 10. If you are 100% confident the business sells to consumers, output a 1. An example of a company that would be a 5 is a company like Facebook who does most of their marketing to consumers but makes all of their money from other businesses. An example of a 1 is a company like an e-commerce brand that sells products to gym goers. An example of a 10 is a company that consults other companies on how to grow.

You can tell a lot about a company by looking at what they are hiring for but now that data is more available, the messaging gets washed out. You're competing with every staffing company and their mother to make the trigger relevant. 

There's a couple ways that you can find companies that recently had someone leave. Here's how you can take action on it. 

1) First build a list of people that recently started new roles. There's no database I currently know of that has a ""recently lost a team member"" data point.

By building a list of people that started new roles, we can look back at their most previous experience and target those companies. 

You can build this list with Sales Navigator and pull it out using exportlists(.)io OR you can use Clay to build the initial list. 

2) Enrich their profile (which you'll need a tool like Clay, Proxycurl, or Iscraper for). Filter for their most recent previous job title and find the people that held titles that are a fit for you. 

3) Now you have a list of companies that recently had a team member leave. Now you can again find contacts for these companies and use Prospeo / Findymail / Datagma to find emails and comment about how they are working without that person.

You need 3 things to launch an effective cold email campaign. 

1. An email infrastructure to send from.
2. A list to send to.
3. Something relevant to say to that list. 

1 and 2 are basically solved problems for most people. 

3. is where the art and the experimentation takes place. 

1. Just use Smartlead or Instantly.ai and literally follow the guides on their website. I tell people all the time, there really isn't anything we are doing differently than their guides. 

We have just solved how to set up and manage quite literally 9,274 inboxes. (I know, Google loves me). 

2. The list. For 90% of people, getting data to first get started is no longer a problem. With the proliferation of tools for every price point, Clay, Prospeo, Findymail, Datagma, ZoomInfo, Wiza, building lists is a solved problem if your audience is on LinkedIn. 

If you sell to local businesses, d7leadfinder is my go to and so is a custom request to Andrew Elsakr.

Don't let these parts stop you. There seems to be so many decisions but they are basically the same. Just keep things simple. 

The third thing you need is the art of testing messaging. This is the most subjective of all and takes the most effort. 

Follow folks like Josh Braun for in my opinion the best guidance on this. 

When you're A/B testing, here's a framework I like to think in. 

List out all of the ways you can help people save time, save money, or make more money. 

Rate all of them by what you find is the most interesting and what your prospects don't know about. Ex. your prospect's know CRMs exist but they might not know that there's a chrome extension that logs all their LinkedIn DM sales conversations automatically. 

Experiment by the biggest value you can bring with a value proposition your competitors can't say. 

Always be thinking ""if someone responds to this email, how do I make it worth their time?""

I wanted a process that we could batch create unique selling propositions quickly. 

The video linked to this post is my current hypothesis on how we can do this. 

If you aren't going to watch the video, here's an overview. 

I've come up with 8 templates that are either designed to modulate to any offer or hack attention. Each template moves on a spectrum of trying to just book a sales call to receiving feedback from customers. 

With those 8 templates, we insert value propositions to be tested. 

Within these templates, we can literally test as many value propositions as you'd like. 

These value propositions are derived from doing the following. 

1) List out all of the ways you can possibly help someone save time, save money, or make more money.

2) Rank those by which are more like a demand capture offer vs. a demand generation offer. (Basically ask yourself ""does my prospect know that this is possible today"". If they all know it's possible and they know how to find people to do it, it's demand capture.)

We want to try testing things that are demand generation offers. The super sexy things that your competitors can't or won't do or the things that your prospects don't even know are possible.

3) Format your best hypothesis into a one line snippet that fits the templates in the video. 

The templates are just to guide you so that you can test value propositions and not think about the overall email.

The biggest reason I love this template? It modulates with your offer and lets you test multiple value propositions easily without thinking about rewriting a whole email.

Here's the template.

Hey {{first_name}}  {{relevance first line OR recency waterfall}}

If we could help you {{messaging to be tested}}, would that be useful to you?

Signature

P.S. {{custom AI generated call out}}

Let's break it down

- {{relevance first line OR recency waterfall}} - this is where we insert relevancy if possible (noticed your commission structure for your AE's is different than your SDRs) OR we insert something AI generated that is recent about the prospect. 

I can make a whole other post on this but we are finding AI generated first lines work great. Relevant lines are the best, but the next best is uncovering something recent about the prospect and making a line about that. 

We tie it all together with a segue about what their company does. 

- {{Messaging to be tested}} - this is where you can insert one sentence about your offer. I've found that testing multiple variations of your offer is necessary to find what your audience resonates with. 

For FlipCX(.)com, we tried literally 8 different campaigns all with completely different copywriting to find that they had one offer that stood out on outbound more than anything else. 

Break your offer down into multiple angles that you can think of. 

- {{AI generated line about how this company could use your solution}} - in my opinion, this is really what makes this template shine. We use AI in Clay to train a model on what the company does for their customers. Then we input what the prospect's company does so that the email can help them think about how the solution can help them in real life. 

We manually write 10-20 to make sure we nail this line. 

- P.S. {{custom AI generated call out}} - We have another waterfall here that finishes the email to add another level of personalization. We do things like finding other people on the team with similar titles and seeing if we should speak to them instead or even deeper explain what about their LinkedIn profile made us reach out to them in particular.

We are still testing with a batch of 8 new customers and once we go through this, we will be turning up the heat for anyone that wants it and remove the waitlist. 

1. Full Account TAM scoring
2. Full Contact TAM Scoring including validated Work Emails and Mobile numbers we have coverage on
3. Full done for you email infrastructure to send 1000 emails per day on outlook/google inboxes
4. I created a 4 phase approach to find message market fit. Each phase ranges from Direct Response pushing for meeting and moves across the spectrum to getting feedback from your customers.  Each phase has experimental templates we run while also testing 3-5 versions of your selling proposition. 
5. Start as soon as you approve copywriting. No warm up period needed. Copy is currently being done by the illustrious Elyse Savaki / Katie Thies. 
6. Integrate with your CRM, your slack, your reps, your parent's cell phone, anything you need. 

So essentially, we can provide all of the account/contact data on your market (limited to LinkedIn data of course) with any enrichment you see in Clay

And we have 8 proven playbooks to find message market fit you can launch with as soon as we have copywriting approved from you. 

Each playbook is designed to either generate leads immediately or get feedback from the market so we know where to take your messaging next. 

Then we scale up what was working with our sending infrastructure on google and outlook.

urn:li:activity:7188567156773519361,"Clay is actually the cheapest employee you'll ever hire and you're getting hung up on credits to realize it. 

Clay is essentially a workflow tool that brings together all of your favorite data providers into one workflow. People tell me all the time they think it's expensive and I remind them to look at their alternative. 

On the $349/month plan, you get access to HTTP API calls which are completely free to use in Clay and unlimited. 

Here's a regular workflow that every person doing cold email campaigns needs to do. 

Pull your original list
If the list comes with emails, you have to validate them (uploading a csv of 2000 records to debounce might take 10 minutes to validate
Download that list
Clean First Names
Clean Company Names
Download list
Upload to your sending tool

If you are hiring an assistant to do this and you want them to actually focus on what they are doing, you're probably paying at least $800 per month. 

If you're using Clay, you can do all of these steps automatically and without any mistakes for under $400 per month an UNLIMITED amount of times...

Leverage the custom API keys and integrations in Clay and I guarantee you, it is always better to be using Clay than the alternative of hiring someone to do these tasks or paying for large annual deals that you're only going to need once you can get with Clay. 

Never use credits for email verification
Think about how big your prompt is for open AI and either save money using your key or actually save money using Clay credits. 
If you really need company data cheap, don't use clay enrichments for it, scrape it with Zenrows
Use Serper(.) dev for google searches

I check things like do they have my phone number right, do they have my wife's phone number, do they have some large company CEOs mobile number after I know they changed it because they told me. 

What email do they have for people that work at slack (because their email domain is slackhq.com not slack.com)

I check the recently changed jobs filter in Sales Nav against the database data to see what job changers they detected. 

Do the companies that get listed as ""SaaS"" actually get tagged correctly? 

I check a lot of things that I just know to poke and prod at data companies because I live in these platforms. 

One test I don't think I've ever seen a platform get correctly is the CEO of Stripe. 

Google it right now, his name is Patrick Collison but on LinkedIn, his title is ""Content Strategist"" so he can hide from people like me.

Many of our customers are SaaS companies that want to sell to other SaaS companies. But no platform is the single best at clicking a button and producing a list. 

So I built a workflow using ZenRows inside Clay to scrape company websites for the information. 

We have pulled data from Apollo, Crunchbase, Harmonic, Ocean, ZoomInfo, and Owler to see who has the best SaaS filter. 

We are going to score each company in multiple ways to see which list performs the best.

First, we are going to ping the website with Zenrows to get a scrape of the home page. We will mine it for keywords that are classic SaaS keywords.

Then we are going to use Serper to create Google searches that also look for classic SaaS keywords. 

Finally, we will run Claygent on each website in order to make a determination if the company is SaaS or not. 

So far we have collected over 100k rows of Companies that these platforms say are SaaS or Software companies.

Relevance AI I just started playing with to help us build custom agents that can access the internet and other tools to do repetitive research tasks. 

Exportlists(.)io - still in a bit of beta but a great product to pull contact lists. 

LeadMagic email finder and verification. Jesse Ouellette amazes again with his low costs products. And the email verifier is crazy fast. 

InducedAI - this is a platform doing some really interesting work around RPA browser automation that you can ping via API. Some tests I did were to find the average price of an ecommerce store and it did very well at this.

Zenrows is a data scraping tool that comes preloaded with proxies, the ability to parse data, and java script rendering. 

3 reasons I'm such a big fan

- It's super easy to use for non coders like me
- the parsing of the data is really organized
- it's super cheap

Here's some pages I've scraped and returned all of the important information from. 

Builtwith - every public builtwith link is builtwith(.com)/detailed/{{domain}}. You can use zenrows to scrape the page and then do a keyword search in the data to find the technologies you want to check are installed. 

Capterra - scrape it for reviews and other data off the page

Owler - Great for scraping funding data and competitor data!

Glassdoor - grab all of the open jobs, reviews, and what people said about the company. 

Indeed - similar use case as glassdoor but from the number 1 hiring site by volume besides LinkedIn

Crunchbase - this was like getting an early Christmas present. The amount of data you get back from crunchbase is amazing. 

Similarweb - you can get all of the web traffic details from their programmatic pages. 

You can also scrape YouTube, Gartner, Comparably, Clutch, the website you're viewing this from and so many other pages. 

Combine this with Serper(.)dev so that you can take any company name or any website and find the data you're looking for. 

If you're still reading this, here's a short list of data that I've been able to scrape for .0001 - .0025 depending on how much anti scrape the pages have. 

- Revenue
- Technographics
- Intent data (yeah from Bombora that they are integrating with the programmatic pages. But who even knows the accuracy here.)
- Department headcount churn and growth...
- Events Attended and Sponsored
- Funding Rounds
- Total Funding
- Location Count
- Competitors
- Industry Classifications (you can hit multiple pages and use AI to output a better industry classification).
- Investors
- Recent Company News
- Web Traffic data
- Mergers and Acquisitions
- All Social links for a company
- Tech spend
- G2 Reviews
- Capterra Reviews

End to End Google and Microsoft inbox creation and DNS set up

- We can now set up google inboxes and microsoft inboxes automatically and deploy DNS settings at scale. Allowing us to onboard new customers quickly and spin up new inboxes as soon as campaigns start to take a hit. 

TAM Account Scoring as an included deliverable

- A vision I have with our services is to give you a market map of your TAM right from the first month with any data point important to your company. I announced a little about this on Monday and we have begun to deliver the first fully scored TAM lists to customers. Some are over 100k records and include department headcount scoring, open jobs, revenue, keywords on site, web traffic growth, events the company sponsors, etc. 

TAM Contact Scoring as an included deliverable

- Why not just make it crazy and give all of the validated emails we can find (powered by Prospeo) and every mobile number we can find?

New onboarding process allowing us to launch brand new customers right after they approve copywriting.

- Probably the most exciting change for us. We are launching new customers within 48 hours after they approve copywriting and skipping the normal 3 week warm up period. 

Ramped up the scope working with Elyse Savaki and Katie Thies. Saying they are only helping with copywriting is an understatement. They are bringing full blown strategy to the team. 

- These two are absolute legends. Put in strategy requests with their consulting companies before I hire them full time. 

Hans Dekker completely rebuilt our internal analytics so we can better track what's going on when we send 1.5M emails per month.

Clay at it's heart is a spreadsheet connected to APIs. The outbound use case is powerful but there's so many other things you can do. 

1) Automatically create outbound copywriting ideas for our clients. 

Clay allows us to scrape the website for content and find case studies for content as well. Then it goes through a GPT-4 workflow to give us copywriting ideas. 

2) Find local gyms and sort them by reviews

I love to drop in to CrossFit gyms when I'm traveling but often times, the gyms that have the best SEO presence aren't ALWAYS the most fun to go to. I've used Clay to find the gyms where I'm traveling so I can review all of them by google ranking, reviews, and take a screenshot of their homepage so I can comb through all of them in one sheet. 

3) Monitor for concert tickets I want to go to. You can use the RSS Feed to monitor ticket sites and then filter for bands or events you actually want to go to. 

4) Automate cold email campaign reporting.

Make and Zapier are going to charge you for every single run you do but Clay is completely free to run APIs with your key. So we will run some really long reports that need a bunch of enrichments and shoot them back into a google sheet. 

5) Create slack notifications for tasks added to a project management board. 

Just another thing I hate paying make or zapier for. When a new task gets added to clickup, it sends a webhook and sends that data to slack. You can use Clay to even look up who it was assigned to so it sends to the correct person in a dm. 

6) Like my wife's instagram posts automatically. Use the Phantombuster phantom ""Instagram Profile Post extractor"" to bring the post data into Clay. It can check as often as you want for new posts. Then I end the workflow with the Auto Liker and commenter. I bring this into my clay workflow so I can also get a slack notification and comment something nice. 

7) Enrich your calendar invitations for more background about them. 

You can send a webhook anytime someone books on your calendar. Enrich their email address for anything you need. Their LinkedIn profile, phone number, last linkedin post, screenshot of their website, etc. 

8) Admittedly, this does include sending emails but not for sales. 

We are looking to get our fire place done so instead of asking for quotes manually, I found all of the chimney/fire place people near me. Scraped their websites for their email, sent an email requesting a quote and hooked my inbox up to another clay table to keep all responses in one place.

9) Automatically pull top Reddit posts with the RSS integration for content ideas.

urn:li:activity:7176203943151050752,"5 steps to start cold outreach in a weekend with the leanest tech stack possible. This stack is built for complete ease of use and speed. 

- Buy Domains on Porkbun or Godaddy. Skip the cheap domains and only buy domains similar to your domain with .com or .co top level domains. Forward those domains to your main domain so prospects can research you. 

- Set up inboxes with Gsuite or Outlook. Both are great. Gsuite might be a little better for deliverability but Outlook is a little easier to set up.

- Get yourself an Instantly.ai account. I suggest this because they have everything you need in one place. Contact data, email verification, email warmup etc. For those that have never done cold outreach before, it's all there in one place for you. 

- Start warming up your domains. If you need to get started immediately you can start sending 7 emails per day per inbox with an hour delay between each one. But you should really wait 3 weeks if you can. 

- Use their Unified Inbox and CRM to keep track of your leads and transition them to your main email after you have a meeting. 

Theres some extra bells and whistles that you can add in as well. But if you really just needed to get started and didnt want to work in multiple tools, this would be your best bet.

urn:li:activity:7175843782439907328,"James Winter made a phenomenal resource for the Telescope Partners portfolio companies regarding outbound in 2024. Here's 3 things I added for them to keep in mind. 

1. Those that give more, make more. 

Hans Dekker pulled all of our past winning campaigns to find customers that we should replicate. 17/20 winning campaigns gave something away for free (that the prospect know other companies are charging for - ex. not your pre recorded webinar). 

It ranged from easy things like gift cards to really detailed strategy plans, industry insights, data, free workflows to solve micro problems, etc. 

Your offer is king and a lead magnet moving towards that offer helps a ton. 

2. Long Sequences are dead. 

I'll take the stand and say sweeping declaration that no one should be running an automated 7 email long sequence. I'd still argue anything over 4 emails in a sequence is not helpful too. 

- Across every single campaign we run, Email 1 is the best performing email by far not even close. Maybe we stink at writing follow up emails that over 100 customers have approved of, or maybe you should send to new people more often. 

- by email 3, you have exhausted any relevant data you were using as an outreach. The data you were using might not even be true anymore. 

- you are wasting your sending volume on talking to people that have already seen your offer multiple times and didn't engage. If I had to choose between emailing a net new contact or a follow up, I'd pick net new every time. 

- ""But Eric, I get so many responses to my 6th email"". I'd argue you need to take that email and make it number 1 and it would perform even better. Or you just got lucky that something changed in the business that made what your solution is a priority now. 

- For every person you follow up with and get a positive response on email 6, there are 10 times as many people marking you as spam or unsubscribing. 

- You can still get just as many touch points with customers by loading up a 3 email sequence, running through your list, and then refreshing the data, refreshing the copy and running those people through another 3 email sequence. 

I rest my case, number 2 should be it's own post. 

3. Testing Value propositions might be more important than triggers. 

I know most of my posts are about automation, triggers, scraping and AI, but we are finding more and more that testing various value propositions to see what people care about is much more important. 

Is it interesting that we can target the founder who used to be an engineer that just raised a Series A that's hiring their first sales person, mentions outbound in their job description AND is using HubSpot? Sure

But if we get the offer right, that person would still respond without shortening our list to under 100 people.

We are actually completely rebuilding our onboarding process to account for literally 10x more offer/outcome/value proposition testing.

That was a fad that was started in the super early days of Jesse Ouellette's whatsapp group called the SaaS Yacht Club. 

We were all joking that it was going to be the next best thing to cold email. Someone let the cat out of the bag and posted about it on LinkedIn. Everyone in the whatsapp group piled on to the post and engaged with it. 

It ended up getting 10s of thousands of views. 

Then someone else posted about it with a poll. That went crazy because at the time polls were being pushed by the LinkedIn algorithm like crazy. 

So we all posted polls.

Still this was a complete joke. 

Then we started seeing people legitimately suggesting the strategy that weren't in the whatsapp group. 

Then we started seeing TikToks about people actually doing it. 

Then we saw LinkedIn posts bashing the concept. 

Then we saw news outlets like the NY Post pick it up and make stories about the new age of prospecting. 

All because a silly little whatsapp group gamed the linkedin algo and made people think we genuinely thought it was a good strategy.

I often tell people that the best way that we can help your team is to scale the same message you'd send with 10 minutes of manual research with AI and automation. 

This prompt and workflow in Clay gets us closer to that. 

When you send a message to someone, most often you are checking their LinkedIn profile, the company and some custom data point. 

Then you need to be able to train an AI on those insights to write messages to your whole market. 

So we built 2 tables. 1 to gather your insights. 1 to actually write the messages to your prospects. 

The first table collects your information from a form. Who are you reaching out to and did you do any custom research on them? Right now we are working with 3 inputs, but can scale to more of course. 

You can train the AI given the information about the example prospect and what you said with that information.

In this table we also have templated messages you would normally send and an input for background on your company. 

Then we send that data to a table with all of your net new prospects you actually want to send emails to so that the emails could be generated. 

Below is a video explaining a preview of the whole process. For those that might ask, this is not ready in my opinion to be shared as a template so I can't share it yet. 

And for anyone saying that we should just train a custom AI from OpenAI on this, sure but this is how we can get one off the ground in minutes without any coding.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7174066378943926272,,1 year ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,1.0,,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes

As some of you might know Ocean.io has probably the leading company lookalike audience builder in the market today. You can just upload 3-5 of your best fit customers and get companies that look like them based on their scoring algo. 

On top of that, you can further filter and refine with their filters that are similar to most other platforms. 

A big key difference with Ocean is the amount of keywords it gives you access to search right in it's native database. 

Often times we are building lookalike searches AND searches based on keywords to build a hard to reach TAM list. 

Construction Rental Equipment in France -> Done
Law Firms in New Jersey that deal with wrongful termination -> Done
Airbnb Property Management Companies in Florida -> Done

But on top of all of this data, you can further double confirm your lists or add more companies to your list with Serper. 

Serper is the cheapest Google SERP scraper I've found so far (thanks to Erol Toker for the suggestion). It allows you to scrape Google searches at scale and super cheap. We use Google search operators to further refine our searches to double check a company is a good fit. 

You know what keyword a law firm that does wrongful termination work is going to list on their website? ""wrongful termination"" For less than $10, we can score 10s of thousands of websites for having keywords that validate we should be reaching out to the company.

urn:li:activity:7173306370149072896,"Heres why we dont get obsessed with trying to find every single persons email on our lists. 

I see tons of people in the Clay slack community requesting email waterfalls to have as many providers as possible. 

This is pretty much wasted effort after 2-3 data providers in my opinion. 

For those that dont know, an email waterfall is when you input things like Name, Website, LinkedIn profile, into multiple data providers to increase your coverage. 

Maybe one data provider will have data another one doesnt. While this true, its mostly a waste of time. 

This has to do with how the sausage is made.

Why are there hundreds of email data providers and a fraction of them offer mobile number data? Because email data is so easy to get. 

Think about your email. For my founders out there, its probably firstname@companydomain.com. Doesnt take a rocket scientist to guess that. 

Most of these data providers are simply taking names and trying normal permutations and seeing which ones validate. 

So then the question comes well Eric, if they all do the same thing, why is coverage different?

Because the underlying validation of the emails have different quality to them which is why we still check 2 or 3 but never 7.

I showed this workflow yesterday on the templates launch event and I wanted to make sure I posted for everyone to see. 

This workflow automtically takes in any input of Names, emails, LinkedIn profiles, and websites and automatically enriches to...

1. Find and validate email addresses for safe email sending
2. Create 3 creative ways the target prospect can take advantage of your solution
3. Find case studies mentioned on the target prospect's site.
4. Find competitors of the target prospect.
5. Find someone else that works at the company with a similar role. 
6. Confirms the person is still working at the company and how long they have been there.
7. Creates an analogy between your company and the target prospect's company. 
8. Creates a line you can use in follow ups talking about how you know their main priority is helping their customers so they shouldn't have to worry about that annoying thing that your solution solves (this is of course AI generated to change for each prospect.)
9. Creates an AI generation of what the company does. Perfect for first lines or keeping your CRM updated.
10. Finds the most recent non active experience in their work history so you can say something like ""Hey Eric, I know you didn't leave {{past company}} to worry about _____""

Many of the columns can be edited for exactly what you need to fit your company and value proposition.

One pet peeve I have with cold email copy is seeing people A/B test campaigns by just saying the same thing in a different way. 

When you run your A/B tests, create messaging that tests your value proposition and what your prospects care about. 

Sometimes the things that inbound sales come to you for are not the same things that will pique the interest of an outbound prospect. 

The framework we use to think about value props is by breaking down offers. 

There are only 5 offers in the world that Im aware of. 

Help people save money
Help people save time
Help people make more money
Help people be healthier
Help people raise their status

In B2B, we only need to worry about the first 3 most of the time. 

Think about an email enrichment tool. 

They help me save time because they might get an output faster than anyone else. 

They help me save money because they are cheaper than everyone else. 

They help me make more money because their coverage allows me to talk to more people. 

If an email enrichment provider reached out to me about saving time or money, I wouldnt care at all. Prospeo has me on saving money. Clay helps me save time.

This email is pretty easy to do with AI in Clay and of course is pretty scalable. If you saw my other post today, this definitely uses data to hack attention vs. actually show relevance. 

So I know the relevance vs. personalization police might come out of the woodwork but adding something as simple as this first line does increase responses. 

We have one campaign that mentions the top steakhouse in the area for a payment processing company we work with and it increases response by 5x. Don't hate the player, hate the game. 

Anyway, to do this, you can just open up your Clay account and enrich your leads with their LinkedIn profile enrichment. Map out where the prospects went to college and then you could literally just ask AI what is a cool recent fact or noteworthy event that happened at the college. 

Further use AI to massage the line so it works into your campaign copywriting. Don't let AI generate the ""Saw you went to Rutgers, word on the street is"". Use that as a prefix in the prompt so it comes out like that every time. 

Since the data was updated to April 2023, you'll get way more good coverage. And the odds are almost 0 they went to a college that was founded in 2023. 

Yash Tekriwal > had a great idea to leverage colleges on the follow up message I can maybe talk about another time. 

Basically to use the college to really hack their attention as a last resort in email 3 or so. 

Put a 2-3 word event or tradition in the subject line from their college.

This email leverages data to do a personalization I usually refer to as an ""attention hack"". 

For all your relevance vs. personalization police, no it's not that relevant but lines like these do increase your response rates which I'm sure the Rippling team is benefitting from right now. (Recently, I have converted Jordan Crawford to the attention hack side.)

If you want to do something similar, you could actually do this for free in Clay. What they are basically doing is finding people that are hitting anniversary milestones in their business. (I got this email for my 2 year anniversary as well). 

You can use the find people source in Clay to find ""Founder"", ""CEOs"", etc that have been at their company for 35-37 months so that you can get people right at that 3 year mark. 

Then you can enrich their profile to confirm they've been working there that long and send your email. 

This is great for a company like Rippling with such a large TAM and with so many people hitting milestones all the time, they have a pretty unlimited attention hack at their disposal right now. 

They did note that the company was growing fast. Maybe I'd automatically add the name of an employee that was added in the last year to show I know there's actually growth among some other ideas.

When we do copywriting for our clients, this is something that comes up all the time. And there's basically two schools of thought.  
 
On one hand, if you mention a case study and they know who it is, and it's similar to their company, reply rates will increase! Also you're adding more conviction to your case study because you can name a real company that they can actually follow up with.  
 
One the other hand, if you mention a company and they've never heard of that company or it's not similar to their company, it could actually hurt your outreach because it lowers the relevance to the prospect.  
 
Here's how we decide when to include it and when not to.  
 
If the results you drove for the case study are truly incredible and you can prove it on the call or in your sales process, you don't need to mention the company.  
 
If you have pulled your list specifically to find other companies that are similar to your case study, mention the case study. (*unless you do something proprietary and by sharing solutions it wouldn't look great).

- Email every CEO in your TAM blindly and hope to get an intro to the right person.

urn:li:activity:7166101310021316608,"When you try to do things ""right"" analysis paralysis can set in. Here's some things beginners and advanced emailers don't think about while intermediate people spend too much time.  
 
- Your offer and the list you send that offer to are more important than literally everything.  
 
- Catch all emails. Unless your TAM has only 5,000 prospects in it (which I would question your choice of TAM here 
) and every single email is gold, don't worry about trying to validate the catch all emails.  
 
Just toss them away and when you use your whole list and you have a winning campaign, think about using tools like Scrubby to validate the catch all emails.  
 
- Being cheap with inboxes/domains - too often I see people buying cheap domains, cheap smtp servers, or using other shortcuts to set up their email infrastructure. When really we are talking about $50-$100 per month for most people. Spend the money.  
 
- Trying to save domains and inboxes. Continuing from above, I see people get domains or inboxes banned from Google. Maybe they get blacklisted without getting banned.  
 
I see so many people spending time thinking about how it happened, how can they undo it, and trying to implement fixes. Really, you should just set up new domains and try to find problems later. Everything else is going to help only marginally. Spend your time just resetting the system.  
 
- Private LinkedIn profiles - this is mostly a complaint I see within the Clay community. ""I can't build my whole list because there are people that have private profiles."" Again, don't worry about it.  
 
Start building your list, send your campaign, worry about this after. Use sales nav and phantombuster to get the private profiles when you're ready.  
 
- Asking your friends for their opinion on copywriting. As long as you send an email with less than 100 words, social proof, quick value proposition and a soft CTA, anything your friends say is just an opinion.  
 
Test all your ideas and let the market decide.  
 
- Over evaluating tools. I saw one person getting a 7% open rate get a 53% open rate by switching to a platform that doesn't charge per inbox. They delayed making a full switch for 2 months because the platform couldn't send attachments in the outbound messages...crazy  
 
- AI personalized lines are not nearly as important as your offer and making a list that needs that offer. AI will help multiple campaign success, not create it.

urn:li:activity:7165754290978992129,"Here were some of my biggest takeaways from the Acquisition.com scaling workshop last week. 

1) The biggest focus for Acquisition.com and their team is to identify the constraint of the business properly and remove it. There's no secret sauce or anything they don't talk about publicly. It truly is their main focus. 

2) The same amount of effort that is put into finding new customers should be used to bring in new team members. Hiring is often one of the most common constraints that need to be removed. 

3) Track what you need to fix. I asked Neil Assur what are a list of metrics I should be tracking. Besides the important ones like Lifetime value, cost to acquire customers, gross profit, net promoter score, etc. He said to track enough so you can identify what's the constraint in your business and then become obsessed with tracking every metric that has to do with that. 

4) If an action doesn't get us more customers, increase their value, or decrease risk to the business, we shouldn't think about it.

I created a lead magnet that I thought outbound prospects would love to have for free.  
 
The offer was that I would monitor 10,000 companies for any new hires in their ICP.  
 
I tested the idea on social media and got 85 beta requests off one post. Great.  
 
I launched an outbound campaign. For every 30 people I reached out to, we got a positive response.  
 
The problem was that this was very time consuming to fulfill on. We had to build custom lists, check them with people, etc. I thought I needed to simplify things.  
 
So I said, how about we monitor the same 5 lists for as many people as possible?  
 
Launched on social media, 415 sign ups in one day. I think ""wow, even better than the first, this will crush on cold email."" 
 
Then I launch the cold email campaign and get one positive response for every 300 people we reach out to. That's right. An extra zero added to our original campaign.  
 
So I cold called some people that said no for feedback. The reason why they said no was so obvious, I felt stupid for not seeing it ahead of time.  
 
The people we were reaching out to didn't care about those lists but when I asked if they would want their own custom list monitored 4/4 said they would.

There are 3 pillars of a cold email campaign you need to get right. Email infrastructure, data, messaging. 

The email infrastructure is something that takes up front work but will take about 3 weeks to warm correctly. Get this out of the way first. 

Follow the tutorials from Smartlead and Instantly. It's really not a secret how to set this up even though some gurus will tell you it is. If you follow the steps and use the platforms like the docs say, you will know 90% of what the email deliverability gurus know. 

Use this Make Template to speed up the process of setting up your DNS settings. Just download the scripts from Google drive and upload to Make. Don't request access from me because you don't need it.

The data and your messaging are intertwined and you should spend most of your time thinking about them. 

If I were just getting started, I'd grab a Clay free trial and something like Prospeo and Findymail to find emails without using Clay credits. 

You can build audiences in Clay for absolutely free. Use the credits wisely but build your lists for free and with the help of an email finding tool. 

Building a list of companies is free and then you can find contacts at those companies for free as well. 

At this stage, testing messaging that your audience resonates with is the most important part. 

Keep these things in mind:

1) what can you say in your email that your competitors can't say?
2) How do you make this email worth the recipient's time? 
3) If you were reading this email, would you respond?

In my opinion, everything outside of this is just a distraction or something you need to worry about after you start getting results.

urn:li:activity:7164621524191145984,"Targeting companies with no employees for a task is sometimes more useful than targeting companies hiring for that role. 
 
Imagine you're a company that helps companies with their bookkeeping, financial planning, etc as a service.  
 
These tasks are usually not tasks that can be handled by an untrained person just helping the team out.  
 
If there are no dedicated employees already the company either hasn't solved the problem or they are already outsourcing it. Here's how you can take a guess at which and then message them about it.  
 
To first check if a company does not have a dedicated person on the team for a task, we can use Clay ""find contact"" search to check for employees with skilled titles. In this case, CFOs, VPs of finance, bookkeepers, or otherwise anyone with accounting or finance in their job titles.  
 
Then if you want to change the messaging be inferring if they are outsourcing the task or they haven't hired anyone yet, we can use data to make this decision.  
 
In this scenario, if a company has been around for 5 years but has no finance person on the team, I'd bet they are outsourcing the function. Now you send your best lead magnet/message for people that already have a solution.  
 
Pilot(dot)com has a quickbooks audit tool that you can use without having to speak to anyone on their team coming out in the coming weeks. Perfect use case for this.  
 
If the company has been founded in the past year and they don't have this kind of person on the team, you could reach out about how the tax deadline is coming up and if they need help with their books leading up to April 15, you could help.  
 
Of course this use case doesn't only work for accounting companies but I know that others will see this and no what to do with this strategy for sure.

Here are some AI generated lines we use as first lines or P.S. lines to make the follow up emails pop. 

1. AI analogy. Kyle Rasmussen gave me this idea and it works so well. We basically use AI to make a corrleation between the company we are reaching out to and our product/service. 

2. ""As I learn more about your company"" line. This I stole from @johnbarrows. We use this to insert any kind of fact about their company we are following up about. This changes a ton for each client. Sometimes it looks simply like ""as I learn more about your company and how you help democratize access to sfotware development talent""

3. Local history fun fact. Another great P.S. line where we use AI to give a fun fact about the location the person lives in. 

4. ""I know you're focused on..."" line. We use AI here to infer what the person most likely does day to day by looking at their role and what the company does. We end it with that no good thing they don't want to be doing. 

This looks like ""Hey Eric, I know you're focused on growing the social presence of Growth Engine X and you probably hate thinking about expense reports."" Everything between focused on"" and ""and you probably"" is Ai generated. 

5. College tradition/closest attraction line. I despise people using a college mascot as their personalization but we have found that calling out a college tradiition or nearby attraction in a P.S. line realy gets people's attention and increases responses.

6. Past company line. this one isn't AI generated but it's one of my favorites. We pull their past company to say ""Hey I know you didn't leave {{past company}} to think about {{no good boring thing that causes them problems every day}}.

7. Custom implementation. We also will use AI to create lines about what it would look like for the product or service to be implemented at their company. We analyze the company website, their profile and what the product or service does in order to give custom suggestions about how it would help them. 

Really, the skies the limit with these kind of personalizations. There's a ton more but I'm on a plane and I can't keep writing.

To know about a company's LinkedIn ads strategy is great for prospecting because it tells us other things about the organization.  
 
Off the top of my head, here are 3 triggers that come from the ads data.  
 
1) Are companies even running ads at all? Depending on what you sell, you could be using this to score how many channels a company is advertising on. How sophisticated their marketing team is. How new is the company to LinkedIn ads?  
 
How many ad pixel technologies are they using in combination with the Ads platform. Are they not running ads in an industry that does well with LinkedIn ads? Etc. 
 
2) Are the companies running ads that mention a keyword in them. For instance, might be a good trigger for some of you to find companies that mention GPT-4 but aren't inherently AI native companies.  
 
3) What are the end goals of the ads? Awareness, to get leads, event promotion? Tells you a lot about the strategy of the company and how they currently acquire customers.

Sometimes, it's tough to tell how big an ecommerce brand is by just employee headcount. So we often combine the employee headcount with their follower counts on Social media to get a good approximation.  
 
First, we have to start with a list of brands.  
 
Pull this with builtwith, storeleads, apollo, whatever you like.  
 
Then we are going to go to Clay to find their instagram profiles. You have three options to find the instagram profiles.  
 
1) Use Scrape website to find the instagram listed on the website 
2) Use Claygent 
3) Use the Instagram integration 
 
This is also the order I would waterfall the providers in as well. Scrape website comes straight from the site and is basically 99% accurate. Claygent is doing some searching with AI. Instagram integration is doing searching without AI. 
 
Now that you have the Instagram profiles, I would do the rest of my account scoring right now as well. Find how many employees they have etc. Anything that would disqualify accounts other than follower count.  
 
Then we are actually going to export the list and go to Apify. They have a great instagram scraper that includes many data points in the output.  
 
Most importantly the instagram follower count and the last post!  
 
It cost me $7 to run about 15k profiles the other day so it's super cheap.

urn:li:activity:7163896752952045568,"Here's a 3 step process to target companies by the types of Ads they run on LinkedIn.  
 
LinkedIn just changed the way they show the ads companies are running and you can now filter by the keywords mentioned in the ad and the LinkedIn companies.  
 
Here are the steps to set up your targeting as if you're a marketing agency using this as your trigger.  
 
1) Head over to the LinkedIn Ad library and start creating some searches. The url structure is standard. If you want to make searches at scale you'll need to familiarze your self with it.  
 
This is what it looks like for ads running by Secureframe in the UK, mentioning  
""security"", in the last 30 days.  
 
linkedin(dot)com /ad-library/search?accountOwner=Secureframe&keyword=security&countries=GB&dateOption=last-30-days 
 
Notice that the url can be broken down with custom variables in each place?  
 
/ad-library/search?accountOwner={{company 
}}&keyword={{keyword}}&countries={{country}}&dateOption={{date option}} 
 
Tip: for country code and date, I get those straight from the ad library search result.  
 
For the company name, in my testing, the slug of the company url on LinkedIn gets the best accuracy.  
 
2) Create a spreadsheet so you can create these links in bulk. Have a sheet with your target accounts. Ask Chatgpt to write a google sheet formula that replaces the variables with the company name in your sheet.  
 
3) Go to Clay to have Claygent access the page or use Apify to scrape the pages in bulk. The apify output will include all the information about the ad and can always be imported to Clay for further enrichment anyway.

urn:li:activity:7163237920194183168,"Here's how we personalize breakup emails for most of our clients with Clay and a little bit of AI. I'll link the Clay table so you can immediately start using this. 

Breakup emails have been proven to work. But the emails that scream desperation are the absolute worst thing you can do. 

Breakup emails work because you are signaling to anyone that was thinking of perhaps replying before that this is your last email. Here at Growth Engine X, we also fish for a referral. 

In our break up emails, we usually will ask if there is anyone else to speak with at the company. More often than not, companies do see the issue you're messaging about but you're not actually talking to the right person. Especially at larger companies. 

So in our break up emails, we use Clay to find a person who it could also be their job and we mention them in the outreach. If we don't find anyone, we just say someone else as a fallback. 

Here's how we do it. 

1) we first have to find the email of the person we are reaching out to initially. If we don't have that person's email, we don't waste credits with this workflow.

2) We find contacts that have titles that we should be reaching out to but DON'T have the same title as the person we are reaching out to so that we don't cause a blunder of asking a referral to the same person we are reaching out to. 

3) We use AI to clean the person's name so that we don't ask a referral to Josh Smith CPA, MBA

4) A formula column outputs the clean name OR ""someone else"" so that we always have the correct custom variable token. 

Take a look for yourself in this shared table at how the workflow works and how you can use it for you outreach. 

We are also finding that a similar strategy is working extremely well for breaking into enterprise accounts and we are using it on Email 1. Perhaps another post about that one day. 

Here's the link to the table so you can get access to the workflow without having to build it yourself.

urn:li:activity:7163171979930370050,"People ask me from time to time ""if you're using Clay, how expensive are you campaigns per email sent?"" 
 
My answer is that it always depends on the campaign.  
 
Some campaigns are simple and just require {{first_name}} custom variables because the list is grouped so closely together.  
 
Some campaigns use multiple steps of AI, LinkedIn searches, and other data enrichments. I pulled our cheapest campaign to run and one of our more expensive campaigns so you could get an idea of costs.  
 
Cheapest campaign 
 
Data sources 
 
Apollo - we pay .025 per each email but because a credit stays unlocked after you save it, we actually pull a lot of data we have pulled in the past. (For instance, we have every CEO of a startups saved already and when we run those campaigns it's basically free).  
 
Prospeo on the top plan is .007 per valid email found. They are our next email enrichment partner. For any email that we can't find in Apollo, Prospeo is our go to in order to fill in the gaps.  
 
Debounce on our plan is .0005 and is our email validation of choice.  
 
Say we pulled an email from Apollo it wasn't valid so we pulled an email from Prospeo as well and used debounce both times. The cost per email sent is .0325 not accounting for other expenses.  
 
More expensive campaigns 
 
Same process as above so let's start with .0325.  
 
Open AI costs - ~7 cents per line. We scrape the prospect's website each time for the content using Clay. Then we summarize the text with GPT-3.5 so we don't use GPT-4 tokens on that. Then we use GPT-4 to write the messaging. We usually try to stick to 3.5 to write messaging if we can but we couldn't trust it in this case.  
 
PredictLeads - .016 because it's one clay credit on the highest plan. We use this to get recent news about the company

I'm going to write about the process and give away the template at the end so you can do it yourself any time.  
 
People ask me for this all the time or I see it posted all the time. It's pretty easy to do with Clay but I don't talk about it often because the odds someone was on a podcast in your list is actually very low.  
 
Even if you manually try to do this, your hit rate is not going to be unbelievable.  
 
That being said, here's how to do it automatically for your whole TAM.  
 
1) Start with your list. You'll need prospect name, title, company. 2 out of the 3 data points here could work but accuracy will go down. If you only have one of the three,  I wouldn't even try it.  
 
2) Upload your list to Clay and open the Claygent integration. The prompt you're going to put in is to basically check listen notes for an episode with the CEO on a podcast. The prompt is pretty extensive so you can check out in the Clay template linked below.  
 
3) After you found the podcast link, you can either ask Claygent to revisit that link to get information about the episode or work with what Claygent already brought you so you don't incur more OpenAI costs.  
 
4) Use GPT-3.5 or 4 to write the line the same way you would if you were reaching out to someone manually and send those emails!  
 
Hope this was helpful. Here's the link to the clay template so that you could do this yourself!

The best CTAs are tied to great Lead Magnets. 
 
A question I ask my self when creating outbound campaigns is ""how can I make this worth this person's time?""  
 
A lead magnet is a free offer that you can do on behalf of a prospect to get their attention and build trust. It should be something that someone else on the market is charging for. Not your recorded webinar.  
 
If you send someone something valuable and worth their time, you will get meetings. Guaranteed. End of story. Fight me on it.  
 
So why would you steal that CTA from your favorite LinkedIn influencer and not think about how you can make your email worth someone's time.  
 
This is the clearest process I have found to make value driven CTAs.  
 
1) List out all problems you can solve for a prospect.  
2) List out all the solutions to those problems that you can provide for your prospects.  
3) Out of these solutions, what can you solve for free and at the most scale?  
 
Test out those CTAs until you find the one that works the best for you.  
 
Here's some great ones we have used.  
 
- Could I send a list of people that just installed HubSpot? 
 
- If it sounds useful, we can build a list of 5,000 of your ideal customers on a call sometime.  
 
- Let me know if you'd be interested in an audit and we can connect you with a marketer that has already grown a business in the {{industry}} space.  
 
- We can build that workflow for free if you just send us a google sheets link.  
 
I get it, sometimes, you have to use a soft CTA because not everyone has a great lead magnet. But I'd really recommend you try to create one.

I don't want this post to show that we can do this for anyone because transparently, we can't. There's so many factors to watch out for to make an outbound campaign work. But when it works like this, it feels great. 

Keep in mind a couple things.

- Your offer is more important than anything. We have another customer we generated 291 leads in January for. Again great offer. 

- Don't focus on what others are doing for outbound. 

Another one of our customers targets Enterprise companies. We generated only 6 leads for them in a week but each with each potential deal is multiple 6 figures of opportunity. Doesn't look as cool as this but still powerful.

Now a company lost a strategic thinker or contributor and they have a gap they need to fill. Not a bad time to reach out if you ask me. 

Here's how you can build your list. 

It's not easy to build this list with retail data providers at the push of the button so you have to be a little creative. 

I like to first build a list of my target titles that actually just started at a company in the past month or two. My thinking is most people go from one job to another staying in a similar role. 

Then we work backwards to find the role that they just left and make sure it fits your Ideal Customer Profile. 

Someone that is a brand new VP of Marketing could have left their last company as a VP of Marketing or something similar. Excellent...

Now let's get all of the experiences that are on their profile that they recently left and find our main contacts at those companies. 

Now we can send an email like 

""Hey John, noticed that {{recent employee}} just left the company. Do you have any one taking care of {{job to be done}} while you look for a new person?

While you're looking, we can help close gaps with {{value proposition}}.

Might it be worth taking a look?""

Here's a couple ways we think about when to work on one versus the other and what to do about it. 

This is also assuming your emails are being seen by your audience with a 40+% open rate. 

When is the list the problem? 

Usually when we are getting very few responses (even negative responses) or you have tried various selling propositions and nothing has worked. 

Then we go back to the drawing board. 

How can we build a list of people who have this issue more? 
Are there any types of people that see this issue more? Do they say anything different on their LinkedIn profiles? 
Is there another trigger we can find. 

For instance, one time we were targeting founders and the campaign was working ok. We did a little change and started targeting founders that have never been founders before and we saw a huge uptick in responses. 

If we are getting a lot of negative responses and the when we manually review the contacts, they look good, we work on the message. 

If someone were to tell me that they had a tool that could find emails for less money than anyone else, I wouldn't care. We already have one of the best priced high quality tools in our tech stack. 

If someone were to tell me that they could find emails no one else could find, I'd take that meeting every time.

urn:li:ugcPost:7155972499359322112,"Here's the step by step process to use Clay to scrape the closest connections of your target prospects for warm intros, competitor scraping, or ABM campaigns. 

People ask me all the time, ""how can I scrape the mutual connections of my prospects so I can find the best intro in?"" 

Honestly, this is really hard to do at scale and is mostly a waste of your time. LinkedIn doesn't like you scraping behind a login and you can get your account banned. 

The other issue with this is that more often than not, the prospect doesn't actually really know those connections, they just accepted an invite. 

Enter the ""People Also Viewed Section"". 

In the video below, I outline why I'm so confident the people listed in the section ACTUALLY know your target contact and how you can extract these people at scale. 

Your workflow could look like this

1. Download your connections list
2. Enrich for ""people also viewed""
3. Filter those profiles for ICP contacts and leverage your current connection into the account. 

Or you could do this the other way and pull a list of your ideal customer profile, then enrich for their ""people also viewed"" section and find if any of those people are on your connection list. 

It works both ways. 

There is probably some element of being able to target competitors potential customers which I need to do some testing on. But for warm intros, I have asked 12 other people by now who all confirm they actually know the people in their ""People Also Viewed"" section.

I had no website, I had no content, I had no social proof.

urn:li:activity:7151218710630834176,"This is how we used Clay to send a fully automated campaign getting responses like this for one of the hardest cold email niches...Outsourced Software Development.

First, I need to start this off by saying that our client on this project is amazing and really gave us space to go nuts on this one. 

Here's how we broke down the campaign. 

1) We first built a list of founders that have never been founders before OR they don't have technical experience in their past. 

Clay has all of the data you need on this. You can use their AI formula generator to parse the data the way you need. This way, we know we are talking to people who most likely need our help from the beginning. 

We took care of Account targeting in Ocean.io to target software companies. 

2) We analyzed their main feature pages for what the platform does. Our client has a very particular vertical in software development that he is excellent in. We change the messaging depending on if they have features already that are in his wheelhouse. 

3) If they have those features, we use an AI model to output ideas on how we could make those features even better. If they don't have those features, we use AI to output what it would look like for them if they did have those features. 

There's some other data points and AI written messaging mixed in but this is the most important part of the campaign. 

4) we use a final AI integration to just make sure what we are sending isn't too crazy. We can't let generic ideas or off the wall ideas go out to market. 

Then we plug in the custom variables and ship the campaign. 

If you still think sending emails with AI generated content is a waste of time, I would urge you to reconsider.

We love adding this flare to our follow up emails or even Email 1 in the right instances because many prospects don't know that this is possible to automate. 

You can take a screenshot of a page with tools like ScrapingBee very easily. Home pages are cool but I've found pages deep in the website to be more impactful. 

Step 1: Build your list of target companies using Clay or Ocean.io's LookAlike feature. 

Step 2: Use a Google search or Claygent to find the page on the website that you are looking for. In this case, we used Claygent for two tasks. 1) to find out what is the most popular product of the target company. 2) Find the product page for that product. It was a two step Claygent workflow. 

For those that don't know, Claygent is a feature inside Clay that is AI with live researching capabilities. 

Step 3: We retrieved the page link and put it into Scrapingbee's screenshot feature

Step 4: We did have to have a team manually assess each screenshot for 404 errors, pop ups, cookie banners etc (even though we were blocking these through Scrapingbee's features some still got through).

1. 80% AI generated content

We used AI to analyze the person's LinkedIn profile, their company, and their customers to send them AI generated ideas about how they could use the product. 

For every 86 Leads we uploaded to the campaign, 1 positively responded. 

2. Tech integration campaign

We took a list of 8 technologies customers install on their site that the tool integrates with and sent them each custom copy about how the tool could work with their current workflow. 

For every 238 leads we uploaded to the campaign, 1 positively responded.

3. 2 sentence campaign

We wrote a campaign that was just 2 sentences with a yes or no CTA. Straight to the point, no fluff. 

For every 175 leads we uploaded to the campaign, 1 positively responded.

4. Case study matching

We took a great case study and went to similar companies in that industry to quickly explain how the product could do the same thing for them. 

For every 341 leads we uploaded to the campaign, 1 positively responded

5. Founder Led Sales

We targeted companies with 0 sales team and explained how we could help. 

We uploaded 2,424 leads into the campaign with a 76% open rate. 0 positive responses. 

6. HubSpot Integration Campaign

Sometimes, customers use HubSpot to attempt to do what this product does. We explained why this was a bad idea and talked about the product's great HubSpot integration. 

For every 226 leads we uploaded to the campaign, 1 positively responded. 

7. Competitor switching campaign

We targeted users of a direct competitor and pitched them on switching.

For every 296 leads we uploaded to the campaign, 1 positively responded. 

8. Pitch to join a free community

The title was basically the explanation. This doesn't really compare because the pitch here is a free ask. 

For every 80 leads we uploaded to the campaign, 1 positively responded.

9. New Hire targeting

We targeted personas that recently joined the company in the product's ICP. They had been at the company for 6 months. 

For every 176 leads we uploaded to the campaign, 1 positively responded.

urn:li:activity:7147975253837709312,"Emails 1 and 2 of your sequence are the best performing by far. For 2024, let's send shorter sequences.  

We ran over 500 campaigns for our customers last year and one thing was true about almost all of them. The first email in the sequence got more positive responses than any other email. Email 2 did ok. Emails 3, 4 or 5 really dropped off the deep end. 

Whenever this wasn't true, we took Email 3 and made it Email 1 and it would perform even better as an Email 1. 

Here's my thoughts about longer sequences. 

1) There's really only so many ways to pitch your product or service and it's value prop. After a prospect has heard it once or twice, do they really need to here it again?

2) In my opinion, prospects respond later in a sequence on the 6th or 7th email mostly because priorities have changed in the business and they now need your offer. You could get the same result by moving through your list faster. 

3) After Email 3, unsubscribes go through the roof as a ratio of responses to positive responses. You can assume spam reports are following the same trend. 

4) If you send a shorter sequence, you will reach more prospects in a shorter amount of time. This allows you to speak to as many people as possible that are in market. AND your 4th and 5th touchpoint can be so much better. 

When you normally send a sequence. Maybe you have emails 1 and 2 filled with custom variables. Then emails 3-7 are filled either with the same data OR static copywriting. 

By sending shorter sequences, you can send more targeted and relevant touch points. 

For those that are concerend about reusing the same list over and over again. 

1) Why are you concerned? you were about to send them 4 follow up emails anyway? What's the difference. 

2) We have a customer we are used a two step sequence with for 8 months last year. We reused the list now 4 times and it still gets leads every day.

I don't speak on this often enough but I view cold email like a private ads network. 

So you can have the warmest domains in the world, with the best list, and Josh Braun style copywriting but if the offer doesn't resonate/people don't need what you're selling., you're dead on arrival.

Best Performing Campaign: Helping Forbes book interviews at a conference. 

Worst Performing Campaign: Cybersecurity Services

5 things that made the Forbes Campaign so great. (Whenever I post about this, people comment this is a great comparison because none of their offers are as good as free interview with Forbes. That's kind of the point, this campaign was an outlier because the offer was so amazing.)

1) First and foremost, the offer was a free interview with Forbes. No one was saying no. 
2) We were targeting people at an event where they would be there for 3 days and highly focused on doing things at the event. 
3) We used AI to analyze what the company did and used AI to automatically send possible interview questions in the email so they saw we researched them. 
4) We ran the campaign 2 days before the first day of the event so the event was on everyone's mind. 
5) We used a calendly link in the email (something I usually don't do) in order to grab all of the people that were ready to go without talking to us. 

Overall, this campaign is one of those campaigns that came together so beautifully. Anyone that had their hands on the list and knew halfway decent copywriting could have found success. 

3) hypothesis why Cybersecurity didn't work well. 

1) People don't think about needing cybersecurity services each day. People mostly need cybersecurity when they heard of a friend getting hacked or unfortunately they were hacked. 

This means SEO and paid search are much better traffic sources for this offer. 

2) Cybersecurity is probably harder to sell than gym memberships and for the same reason. People know they should do it but it's really not top of mind for them. 

3) Relevance didn't even break through the inbox. We did crazy things to get people's attention that still didn't work. We scanned their websites to see which ports they had open. Connected that port to a company that was hacked in their same industry through that port and then offered to fix it for free. Crickets. 

Again, I think this is an offer much better served to put budget for when people are searching for something versus messaging them outbound. 

If I had to do cybersecurity again, I'd probably lead with some relevance, a mix of personalization to keep our spam report score down, and increase the volume of the campaign but only send 1 email in the sequence so we are talking to as many people as possible.

When we onboard a new client, this is the framework we use to determine the first 6-10 campaigns we are going to launch for them. 

Each campaign is a different version of emails that they or their team would send manually given 10 minutes to research a prospect. 

THEN we work backwards from there. 

Let's say your ICP is at bare minimum a B2B SaaS company with under 100 employees, 2 years or more since their founding date, and they have to have a Sales Leader. 

This is now our fallback ICP, this is the ICP that we are going email when no other data points are true or available about the prospect. 

Now we turn this on its head and think about our BEST message. Who is the company/prospect that needs your solution the most?

A VP of sales that qualifies for everything above AND is hiring for SDRs, 
AND mentions learning and development in the job description, AND hires SDRs remotely would get one message. 

A VP of sales that is the same but has an in person team would get a different message. 

A VP of sales that isn't hiring for SDRs should get a different message if they have mentioned an Learning and Development budget in a closed job description. 

This can go on and on as long as our client has a data point that they look for that would change the message. 

Then we use Clay to put it all together.

The 3 services we tested were Superwave, Mailreef, and Mailscale.ai. 

As these providers promised, everything for the first campaigns went extremely well.

I just built a free workflow that can monitor 10k websites for new hires in your ICP and Ill send you a notification every Monday. Ill include their work email and mobile phone if we can get it. 

No need to hop on a call, just confirm the titles you want to monitor for and filters of companies you want to monitor and Ill set it up for you. 

Should we get started?



So heres how the providers shook out. 

Superwave 

So far my favorite. We are already deploying this to customers. 

Biggest benefit is that the inboxes were ready the same day. No warm up needed. I was skeptical but so far they have delivered on this promise. 

Since the warmup is so quick we have actually deployed superwave domains to customers already and its going very well. 

Set up is super easy as they do all the inbox setup and give you just the inboxes to connect to your sending tool. 

One time flat payment is also amazing. 

Mailscale 

Onboarded on a self serve platform. Super easy. 3 week warmup was used and the first couple of days of sending were great. They give you a csv for bulk upload. 

Mailreef

Same as mailscale, super easy to setup and easy to connect to your sending tool because they dont use oauth so you can bulk upload as well. 

In our very EARLY tests, things are looking pretty good. I find that if something is going to go wrong, it happens after spam reports start piling on the domain.

2 of those campaigns are our fallback campaigns that if the stars don't align on the others, we send these.

This way we can be running 6 different campaigns from 1 Clay table. I don't mention using AI in every workflow, but AI is used in every workflow to tie the message together. 

Campaign 1: If we are reaching out to a Founder, who has never been a founder before, with no sales team, no retargeting pixels, the company is a tech company, they have raised money, they are under 20 employees, AND they don't have a DMARC record on their domain, we send our best campaign message to this person citing all of the juicy details above. 

Campaign 2: If we are reaching out to a Founder, who has no sales team, and is running a tech company, we send a message with these details and the problems that come with them. 

Campaign 3: If we are reaching out to a VP of Sales or other sales leadership that doesn't have individual contributor sales people underneath them, and we send our next best message. 

Campaign 4: If we are reaching out to a VP of sales or other sales leadership and they do have a sales team underneath them, then we send our next best message. 

Campaign 5: This is our first fallback campaign where we look for enough content on their website and company LinkedIn profile to send a campaign where we use AI to personalize the message to help them envision what working with our customer would be like. 

Campaign 6: This is our second fall back campaign. IF there is not enough content to work with, we fallback to some industry matching where we have an array of case studies for 20 industries and persona messaging to 15 different types of titles.

Before launching your first AI campaign, here's a quick overview of steps to take. 

1) Always work backwards from the message you would send manually if you had 10 minutes to research a prospect.

2) Use data tools like PredictLeads, Clay, Ocean.io, or Harmonic to gather data on your prospects that AI can reference. Don't ask AI to do the research itself. 

3) Plan to have fall back messaging that you can use if someone is still a good fit and worth reaching out to but there's a data point that isn't true about them. 

4) Use Google sheets or Clay's formula generator to double check that the AI is creating a good output before launching your campaign.

urn:li:activity:7138157645164617728,"Here's how to scrape G2 for unhappy customers of your competitors step by step AND a couple reasons why this is a waste of your time. 

I make this post because people ask me how to do this all the time and it's kind of possible but not amazing to automate. I think there's better things to do with G2 reviews that I'll list at the end. 

First, here's how you get it done. 

Step 1: Use a tool to gather the raw G2 Review data. 

Option 1: Clay
Option 2: Instant Data Scraper
Option 3: Scrapestorm
Option 4: ZenRows

This will give you an output of the public data that's possible to collect from the reviews. What the reviews said but more importantly, the names of the people and the titles if they are listed. 

Which is usually the problem because often they aren't listed. 

Anyway Step 2:

Now that you have the raw data, you can use programmatic Google Searches to automatically create searches to find the LinkedIn profiles. A search would look like 

Site:linkedin.com/in/ ""Full Name"" ""Title""

Make sure to use quotes to increase the accuracy. 

Step 3: Now that you have the LinkedIn url you can use tools like Prospeo or Dropcontact to find email addresses. 

So the process is pretty straight forward. Why is this a waste of your time? 

In my opinion, the juice isn't worth the squeeze. A ton of the reviewers don't list their job titles which makes it almost impossible to find them. Also, they were there to leave a review not get prospected to. 

Most companies don't get enough G2 reviews for this give you a good list. And again, the data accuracy is going to be so low, you'll have to manually check things and even then, you usually won't be able to connect the dots. 

What you SHOULD use G2 data for is finding why customers love a company's product before reaching out. Or finding feature requests in the reviews! Use it to find information that you can use when you reach out to the company that owns the G2 page. 

Reach out to the people that left reviews on the G2 page after you've tried everything else.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7138157645164617728,,1 year ago,outboundphd,ACoAABY8znUBoq8OpBYts8DPbLPuOXY0fThy2NY,Eric,Nowoslawski,Founder Growth Engine X | Clay Enterprise Partner,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQF0zwNeNIm1yA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627946879578?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=40M-TlEx3lta297kWxry1Sy4gwRFF0gCBjeW2mzdJpw,,,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes

When you finish your lead list, come up with a different angle and target people that didn't respond. They probably don't remember. Try to put 2-3 months in between starting at the top of your list and then restarting again.

I get the question in the image all the time so I wanted to make a post. 

Some background if you don't know. When sending cold emails, there are tools you can use to check if you are on blacklist or if your emails are going to spam. 

Tools like Glockapps, mailgenius, mail-tester, gmass etc. 

I don't use any of those tools because it's a waste of time. 

Let's approach this logically. 

1 reason your emails aren't going to the primary inbox is because they aren't set up correctly. I have an automation to tell me if inboxes are set up improperly but I also have an automation to set them up properly so I don't need to test if this is the case. 

The other reason is because you are on a blacklist or you have been marked as spam and your domain reputation has gone down. 

If you are getting low open rates or responses, and you run the test and it says you're in spam, what should you do? 

Set up new inboxes

If you are getting low open rates and responses and you run the tests and you're not in spam, what are you going to do?

Not set up new inboxes? No, you're going to set up new inboxes. 

So why even test if the result is going to be the same. If we suspect that a client's domains and inboxes are going down in reputation at all we pause what we are doing, restrategize, and set up new inboxes.

With Ocean.io, all we had to do was add the filters that we would normally add and then add our keywords that we want to search for.

The angle for this campaign is to provide a small list of good fit customers to a prospect for free without ever speaking to them. 

To do this, we analyze who their best customers are and what titles they sell to so that we can programmatically find profiles that would be a good fit and send their LinkedIn profile, email, and mobile number in the campaign. 

Here's what the copywriting looks like -- 

Subject: lists for you

I was on the site and it looks like {{company_name}} target customers are people like {{customer title types}}.

I did some digging in my database and figured these were good leads for you -- 

{{lead}} {{their email}} {{their phone}}
{{lead}} {{their email}} {{their phone}}
{{lead}} {{their email}} {{their phone}}

Our database has over 400m profiles, verified emails and mobiles.

We help companies build custom lists with normal filters like employee headcount and titles, but also more custom requests like searching for how a company collects sales tax. 

Could I build a more custom list of 5000 prospects on a call with you? I'll do the whole thing live and give you what we find!

----

These leads are 100% personalized to them and found for them. 

Here's the TL;DR if you don't have time to watch the video below. 

Step 1: We use AI to find if the company is B2B or not. This campaign only gets sent to B2B companies.

Step 2: We use AI to build a list of prospect titles that they would be looking to target. We find this by analyzing their website.

Step 3: We use AI to output a list of 10 companies that would likely be good fits for the company to sell to.

Step 4: We use Claygent by Clay to programmatically look at the job titles and the company names and find good fit prospects LinkedIn profiles. 

Step 5. We use AI to double check these prospects one more time. 

Step 6: Hopefully we have a list of 7-10 potential prospects that we then enrich for emails using Prospeo. The only profiles that get put into the campaign are the ones we at least have an email for. 

Step 7: We format everything to get sent off in the email campaign!

urn:li:activity:7135303712129884160,"8 strategies that boost response rates in outbound campaigns

Outside of getting your list segmented correctly and having a good offer, here are frameworks that we think about when creating outbound campaigns for customers. 

1. Big Fat Lead Magnet - something you can offer to a prospect for free that is being purchased for real money in the marketplace. 

We offer 5000 free leads in our outbound campaigns or building workflows for free that integrate with their current tech. 

2. Lookalike case studies

Building a list with tools like Ocean.io to sift through companies that are good fits and are extremely similar to a company you have already had success with. 

Your message now becomes ""we've been there done that with a company just like you, want us to show you how we did it?""

3. Problem Sniffing - Using data, AI, or web scraping to find research that you can infer a problem from. Then you message towards that problem. 

Looks like this 

""I saw on G2 a customer was wishing there were CSV import improvements in the product""

""BuiltWith told me you don't have a DMARC record on your DNS. If you want Bill to keep sending outbound emails, here's a tutorial on how to add that to your DNS. Takes two seconds and will increase open rates a ton. 

4. Helping envision a world where your product or service is making things easier for customers. 

We use AI to give ideas about how a product or service would directly apply to a person's role given their role, our value description, and the prospect company description. 

""Wouldn't it be useful if a manufacturing company with 200 employees saw different messaging on your site than if a publishing company with 50 employees came to your site?""

5. Founder Story

This works particularly well for early stage companies. Reaching out to people talking about why you started the company and what problem you are trying to solve. 

6. Competitor audits

Reaching out to companies that we have done research on their competitors and we present how they stand against them and how we could help. (or maybe not if they are great!)

7. Golden ICP scoring and Trigger based outreach

Only reaching out to a prospect if 5-10+ data points are true about them making them an excellent fit OR using relevant triggers so that we only reach out if something is true about the company that isn't always the case. (hiring, fundraising, an employee leaving, product launches, new office locations, etc). 

8. Automated playbooks that just work 
- Targeting people that used to work at your customers and have moved on to other companies
- Targeting people new in their role
- Targeting companies with no dedicated team members for a task
- Targeting people that have never held that specific role before (ex. CTO)
- Targeting users of competitive products with a value add pitch for an integration or new installment. 

9. Entertaining emails - get someone to truly laugh

One way we are doing this at Growth Engine for our own outbound campaigns is offering 5,000 free leads in the ICP. When sending the email, we use AI to determine who their ICP is, give some examples for free, and make our offer.

I see posts all the time of people saying that AI can't write cold email copy or that it doesn't work or people can tell in an instant. 

So here's a real campaign that I partnered with a client on where their team was writing first lines manually and I was using AI. 3 are real lines their team manually wrote. 1 is the line we were using AI to determine. 

Can you tell which content is generated with AI? This was to sell compliance automation software. 

1. I was digging through your site and couldn't find a mention of your Soc II compliance yet, you have enterprise options on your pricing page.

2. Just saw your recent posts about becoming a mother. Congratulations! 

3. Saw you've been the Head of Product since March so I figured you were the right person to reach out to. 

4. Your experience looks amazing. How long did it take to finish that data restructuring at your previous company? I'm sure you're bringing that experience to {{company_name}} now!

I feel like everyone is talking about the email Outreach.io sent out but no one is talking about what they are going to do about it. 

Here's what we are doing to protect our customers. 

Of course we are doing the basics of domain authentication, warm up, list segmentation and I dabble with AI messaging and targeting. 

We are evaluating 4 private networks to take on our cold email volume for our customers. 

We send about 1.2 Million emails per month so we need a provider that is most likely a private sender AND gives us control over switching IP addresses. Everything has to integrate with Smartlead and Instantly.

We are testing these as an agency, this is not an endorsement that we are successful with any yet. It takes weeks to warm up domains so I'm posting this now in hopes that you can get your own tests started. 

1. Superwave - private server network that claims to allow users to start sending emails on day 1 with no warmup needed. Things get better of course if you do warmup your domains. Their strategy seems to be super low volume from a ton of inboxes. 

2. Mailreef - probably the most transparent about their process and what we can change about the servers etc. They are also extremely reasonably priced. Basically if you have more than 30 inboxes the cost works for itself. They allow us to customize servers, IPs, domains, and inboxes. 

3. Sendgrid - Not technically allowed to run cold email from here but I know that Benny Rubin is doing so successfully and we are going to roll the dice. If you think this multi domain stuff is crazy, you should chat with him about his process. 

4. A private network we are building ourselves. We are taking a stab at using our own servers and IPs to send out emails where we are in complete control. A friend of mine has set this up for us and if all goes well, I can be more public about it.

1. Researching a company and inferring that they have a problem.

If you were to reach out to a SaaS company after reading their G2 Reviews about how their CSV imports often break or lack features, you can then send this email. 

""Hey {{first_name}} -- I was reading your G2 reviews and saw how Mary posted publicly about the platforms lack of csv functionality. 

OneSchema is helping companies upgrade their csv import experience without dedicated engineering resources. Would it be useful to connect about Mary's issues and see if OneSchema could close the gap for customers like them?""

2. Story telling into how you specifically helped companies like them. 

Creating a list of companies that are highly similar to companies you have already worked with so that you can speak deeply into your past success and their problems. 

This isn't just about building a list of companies by industry. Banking won't cut it. Banks that do wealth management AND are a credit union is much more specific. 

Create a list of lookalike companies easily with a tool like Ocean.io

So now you can send an email like 

""Hey {{first_name}} -- we've helped other bank transaction data aggregators like Heron Data to upgrade their csv upload experience. 

This is specifically how we helped 

{{Insert your story}}""

3. Create a free offer that they are paying someone else to do right now, but you can do for free. Lean into your strengths here. 

What we do for prospective new customers or outbound prospects is create custom lists, or build workflows for free. 

We create look alike searches, give away 5000 free leads in their ICP with relevant AI messaging written for the first line, build Clearbit outbound campaign workflows, target the closed/won contacts that changed jobs, target companies hiring for roles. 

Yes this costs time and money but it shows the outbound prospect how proficient we are at our work. 

This has created a whole new division in my agency that a person is dedicated to creating for new clients. 

You can succeed with any of these three strategies, but what if you put them all together? 

{{First_name}} -- I figured you are running outbound campaigns considering John is an SDR on the team. 

We just helped another outbound contact data company get 92 outbound leads in 25 days. (Some of the leads were from big names like Stripe, Rippling, and Brex.) We leaned hard into their email verification methodology and an email analysis we made showing how much more data they found with their tool than others. 

Would it be useful to discuss how we generated the leads automatically with our email infrastructure? 

On a call, I'd go over how we ran the campaign and lend you warmed inboxes so you can get started immediately.

urn:li:activity:7128010776023306242,"7 cold email tips from a guy that sends over 1,000,000 emails per month. 

1. Nothing is more important than sending an email worth someone's time to respond. 

2. AI personalization is a multiplier, not a miracle worker. 

If people don't find your offer enticing or the problem you solve isn't their priority, no AI personalization will save you. 

3. Send emails with opinions or insights. 

Your biggest competitors are Excel and complacency. Share your opinion on what people could be doing better or are doing wrong today with their current solution. Or share insights into how they could be thinking about it differently. Insights from a blog don't count. Share personal insights that you have earned from working with customers or in your industry. 

4. It's ok if you track open rates, it's ok not to use spintax, it's ok to send out email without warming up for over a month. 

Somethings help but again, nothing is as important as sending emails that people don't mark as spam. 

5. Invest in your Lists

Just saw a person asking for a list of SaaS companies with Marketing teams under 3 people in the US and they are using HubSpot. They only wanted to build the list if it could be made for free =D

6. Don't be afraid to try something new. 

It really is great advice to send an email like 

Hey {{first_name}} -- {{why I'm reaching out to you in particular line}}

{{Poke the bear question}}

{{Social Proof}}

{{Soft CTA}}

But after you've nailed this, try something new. 

7. Outbound leads are not created equal to Inbound leads

Sometimes the offer that gets people to take action when they are Inbound on your site is NOT the same offer that will get them to take action on Outbound channels. 

Want me to build you an AI powered cold email system L Sounds bleh on outbound

The reason I like this play so much is that 1) it's not overly used. 2) if it's their first time being in a role, they could be needing more help or be excited to make an impact than a person that's been doing the role many times. (you could reverse this process to find people that have held multiple similar roles in the past as well.)

This list is not possible to create in any of the main stream data providers. There's no button you can click on Sales Navigator to build it. 

You need to take a list and build a workflow similar to what I have below and in my video. 

First, start with the list of contacts that generally fit your ICP criteria. Let's say Founders, at Computer Software companies, with 25-100 employees in the United States. 

Then we need to take that list and enrich their LinkedIn profiles to get ALL of their past experience. I used Clay to do this but you can use any provider that gives you someone's total past experience. 

After this, you need to filter their experience titles to see how often keywords like ""founder"" or ""CEO"" or ""Owner"" pop up. 

Then you can filter your total list so that you only have those people and further enrich their email addresses and such. 

Now instead of sending a boring marketing services email you can say something like 

""Hey John, was taking a look at your experience and it looks like {{Company Name}} is the first company you founded! Congrats""

We are finding what features are powered by AI on each tech company's site. And then changing the messaging depending on what they are doing with AI vs. if they are doing nothing with AI.

We complete the whole workflow with Ocean.io and Clay

Step 1: We needed to find SaaS companies that were not AI first. Jasper would be a bad company for this outreach since they are completely an AI product. Clickup on the other hand is perfect because they do project management and are building AI features.

We used Ocean.io to build the list of SaaS companies using their Look Alike feature. Then we used Ocean.io to exclude companies that had AI native keywords. 


Step 2: We used a beta feature of Clay to scan the website and find out what they are using the AI features to do. The feature is called Claygent and it does custom research for you. In this case, it was returning information about what the company is using AI for. 

Step 3: We used regular AI to normalize what Claygent found and write the rest of our messaging. Basically, if Claygent told us that the company is using AI to create custom task lists for the user, we normalized that to say, ""My team told me that you are using AI in the product to help build custom task lists for users.""

We also used Clay to find their competitors, give them recommendations on how our team could build more features for them, and more.

urn:li:activity:7123298903352848384,"These are the campaigns I love building for customers. Predictable, large TAM, AI messaging in every email, great responses, and a pitch that would work even without AI messaging. 

From my experimentation, I've found 4 things to be extremely important to run campaigns. You can run successful campaigns without all 4, but usually one stands out. 

1 - Problem Sniffing - AKA using data and list segmentation to be able to email people that we think have a particular problem. We can then set ourselves up to speak into that problem in the campaign.

2 - An opinion on the job to be done - When companies share their insights with their potential customers of why they should be solving the problem their way, it separates out the crowd of people that want to do something about the problem and those that will never move on it anyway. 

3 - Social proof - Knowing that others have taken action of course will help others take action. 

4 - An offer that's built for cold email - I would never run a cold outbound campaign pitching someone our agency services straight up. Too crowded of a space and it's hard to differentiate ourselves. Customers hire us because of the data segmentation, enrichment, and AI messaging we do. We lean into that and make free offers in all of our emails to get people interested in how we can help more.

urn:li:activity:7122247094169391104,"Honestly, I really don't like running niche campaigns like this screenshot below. 

Campaigns where we find a super tiny niche of people that would be interested in a product and we target them. The math usually doesn't work out. 

The campaigns have under 700 sends here because each campaign is filled with about 250 prospects that we have segmented. And these are the only people that qualify for this campaign. (we got the list from a niche industry group.)

The replies look great but it's not scalable. We have less than 1500 people to speak with in total and once we contact them all, we can't try this campaign for at least another 3 months. 

Of course for this client we already have a plan because I'm a big fan of their product. But what if we didn't? We'd be fired next month even though we got great results this month. 

The kinds of campaigns I love to build are ones where we can tackle a large market segment and the messaging changes depending on what industry, title, and other data points is true about the company. 

We build these campaigns keeping in mind 

1) Problem sniffing/Segmentation of the list - how can we use data to target people by the problem we can infer they have OR segment the list so that everyone is getting relevant messaging. 

Think the difference between saying ""we help ecommerce brands"" to ""we help pet retail brands with a small finance team""

2) Relevant social proof that changes based on data - matching social proof of customers you have worked with in the past to the prospect we are reaching out to as best we can. 

3) An offer (or lead magnet) that would be good enough to get the attention of the prospect that we don't even need the other two items. 

Think offering a company 5000 verified emails for their team to work with for free. 

Yes, small segmented lists are great but not repeatable in the long term.

urn:li:activity:7120837018200231937,"This is the story of how I ran a my most successful cold email campaign ever for Forbes (with a 48% response rate), and what we can all learn from it. 

I had the opportunity to work with Forbes for a one off project at a very large tech event. 

Basically, the event did not put people directly in touch with speakers. You had to use a portal that was often very slow to get information for bookings between press and speakers. 

So we were tasked with scraping the conference speaker list, enriching for emails and targeting the speakers for interviews. 

The offer was an interview with Forbes. No AI written lines. No fancy copy. Just a list of speakers and the offer. Honestly, anyone who knows how to send email could have gotten these results. 

Now it's pretty obvious why this campaign worked so well. The offer was having a free interview with Forbes. 

Who wouldn't take them up on that?

This right here is what separates the great campaigns from the ok campaigns. Having a phenomenal offer. 

I know most of my clients and most B2B businesses have a tough time making an offer in the same realm as this so I'm not trying to say that everyone can do this. And sometimes enterprise software with a 10 month implementation is really tough to offer something for free. 

But the principle still stands that nothing is more important in your cold outreach that putting an offer in front of someone that is a no brainer. 

This is the workflow we usually suggest which we got from Alex Hormozi

1. Make a list of your customers dream outcomes
2. Make a list of all the ways you can help them achieve those outcomes
3. Stack rank what you can do for free at scale and operationalize a lead magnet that keeps bringing customers through the door. 

At Growth Engine X, when we run outbound campaigns, we offer a custom lead list of 2500 leads before asking for a meeting.

urn:li:ugcPost:7118263666709254144,"My favorite way to start an email is with problem sniffing but sometimes, that's just not possible. Here's an example of what we do instead. 

Problem sniffing is something Jordan Crawford coined as basically the way that you use data to try to guess if someone is having an issue or not. 

When you do this, often times, the list becomes the message. Examples like...

- Noticed you don't mention data processing addendum on your website so...
- Just saw the job post for a Senior Engineer and in the description it said you want to set up analytics
- Congrats on the recent location opening! 

In these examples, when you build your list, the list becomes the message. 

For some companies, this isn't possible to do because there's no publicly available data to know if the company might be having an issue. 

So how do you write an email that can still cut through the noise?

We fall back on creating AI written emails that are timing specific and are basically things that a sales rep would reach out with if they could manually research the company as well.

Think recent company news, blog posts, LinkedIn posts, new leadership hires, etc.

Things that basically you would find a company through organic research and then we can dig deeper on them.

1) AI messaging 

First and foremost, I put this here because as I hear other Agency owners having issues with bans, I don't think we do because ~80% of the emails we are sending for our clients have some type of AI generated messaging. 

If you don't think it improves responses, we can have an argument another day. It is definitely helping us stay below the .3% spam rate. 

2) Setting up more inboxes and keeping sending lower. 

In the past we have set up inboxes and sent 50 emails per day. Coming 2024, we are going to move that volume down as we have seen with some clients that are sending lower volumes, the inboxes have much better reputation rates. 

3) Always having domains and inboxes warming in the background that we can swap in.

Yes, it's more expensive to do this but if something goes wrong and inbox reputation starts declining, we can hot swap the inbox instead of waiting for a set up and warming cycle. 

We do all of this along with all of the basic advice of DKIM, DMarc, SPF, custom tracking domain, 3 weeks of warmup, etc.

urn:li:activity:7110614647543607296,"Outbound sellers should use GPT-4 to create cold emails that wouldn't be useful to anyone except their organization.

Let me explain. 

The problem I see with most AI sales tools today is the lack of flexibility. They grant you the capability to say the same 5 things that everyone else on their platform can say.

GPT-4 should be used to create content for your cold emails that are 100% unique to your company and what you can do for your customers. 

Examples (AI generation in * * )

- I saw you had support articles about *csv imports so that customers can easily upload their financial data* -- only useful for OneSchema

- I have to imagine customers call about *canceling their subscription because they didn't use all the vitamins you sent them last month.* -- only useful to Flip CX

- I noticed you're looking for a *digital marketer who is going to be responsible for A/B testing creative on your ads channels considering the job posting said ""experience with optimizing ad spend"".* -- only useful for MarketerHire

Notice how none of these fall back to what the person did in their past roles, company news, fundraising, or their last company blog post. 

As more digital noise is created in outbound channels, sellers will need to find a way to stand out at scale. I see too many sellers and marketers backing away from AI because it's too hard to learn. 

We all knew a technological change is coming and will keep coming. We knew it was going to be hard.

I know that is kind of a mouthful so let's unpack it. 

One of our customers wanted to call out a competitor and compliment the prospect on why customers probably opt for them instead of the competitor. So as usual, we got to work. 

Step 1: We need to find who the competitor of the company is. A google search for ""{{Prospect domain}}"" competitors {{Country}} will get you what you need.

Step 2: We used AI to interpret that Google search and figure out which company in the first 3 results on Google is the most likely competitor. 

Step 3: Now that we have the competitor, we need to find more information about them. There's a lot of ways to do this. I opted for a google search for their LinkedIn company page. site:linkedin.com/company/ {{Competitor Name}} 

Worked like a charm

Step 4: Now we need to compare the two company descriptions and output a line about how customers differentiate them. I'll put the prompt in the comments because it's kind of long. 

Finally, we are left with a line that we can use in our outreach automatically. I would be careful with this one as sometimes what companies like Crunchbase, Similarweb, and G2 say about competitors is not always the best so we had some stops in our workflow to ensure this.

2) Dropcontact
3) Datagma and Findymail
4) Hunter.io
5) People Data Labs
6) Nymblr - Verified B2B Leads & Custom Audiences for Salespeople & Marketers
7) Snov.io

I changed the methodology to be as robust as possible and I think you'll agree it's much better.

Here's the methodology behind this test. 

1) My agency sends 850k cold emails per month. We use debounce on every email that we send. 

The sample that we are testing on are emails that we received an actual reply from in the last month. Not an automated reply. Not an out of office. An actual reply. 

The thinking here is that these emails are the most valid list of emails we can get since someone actually replied. 

Possible error source - someone changed a job in the 3 weeks from when we possibly picked up a reply to when we ran the test. 

2) The sample size is much bigger. The last test was about 2000 contacts. This sample size is 4,000+. 

3) We also did an exact match search on the email that was returned to ensure the data provider not only returned an email but they also matched the email that sent us back the response. 

Enrichment was done either by Name + Domain or LinkedIn profile.

I believe the results speak for themselves in the image. The industry and company size varied greatly. Every email from this test was of an HR professional at companies with 10-10,000 employees. No specific industry because the offer was just for HR!

One thing to note is that some of these providers have catch all recovery which was omitted from this test since we only send to valid emails.

Heres the copy with an explanation of how we put it together. 

First, we are going to scrape Google Maps for gyms in every Zip Code of the US. We will qualify by looking for gyms that have more than 30 reviews. 

Second, we are going to find the gyms currently running Facebook Ads/have a Facebook ads pixel.

Could I send you our Facebook Ads blueprint that other gyms are using to get 20-30 members/month? Totally free of course.

Signature

P.S. I wrote some Facebook Ad copy for you considering your location, what you do as a gym, and your member reviews. 

{{AI Generation of Facebook Ad copy}} 

***

The way we are able to create this base list is with a google maps scraper from Clay or in bulk with Andrew Elsakr. 

Then we can use BuiltWith to find the Facebook ads pixel on their site. 

From there, we can enrich their reviews AND do the AI copywriting inside Clay. 

The way I did the copywriting was with this prompt and 3 examples that I gave manually. 

Consider the inputs and create some copywriting that could be used for a Facebook Ad. Consider the location of the gym, their company description, and what some successful members had to say about the gym. These are the inputs. Gym location: {{Gym Location}}. Company description: {{Company Description}}. Reviews: {{Reviews}}. Keep the output under 200 words. Think creatively about what would get the attention of someone in the location of the gym that is looking to lose weight. Highlight the success of the members review and use the AIDA framework to write the Ad.

I have another idea that analyzes their local market that Ill try too but this one is already working. Ill definitely be asking to see how this compares to what they are already doing.

My main problem with break up emails is that too often, people use them as a way to beg a prospect for a response. With this framework, you are showing you've done your research and are looking for a referral. 

AND turns out, this is pretty easy to automate. 

1) Upload your list to Clay
2) As your last enrichment, use the ""Find Contacts"" enrichment to find people that are in your ICP department but exclude the title of your prospect so we DON'T call out their name in the email. 
3) Use a keyword contains search to double check again because that would kill the whole outreach.

The customer we sent this campaign to runs a venture backed community to help entrepreneurs/CEOs build their network and take care of their mental health. 

The ole' cold email CEOs to join your group campaign has become overdone and is starting to lose positive responses as recipients become jaded to the messaging. 

The problem is that we are claiming that we hand picked them to join our community but they know it's an automated email. So...let's challenge that. 

Relevance is going to be a little bit of a problem because I can't really look for a job ad to know if they would be willing to join a community. 

Instead, we used 3 types of AI prompts to automatically personalize the email so that they would receive messaging on why we were inviting them. 

The prompts were based on their most recent LinkedIn post or something on their LinkedIn profile that makes them stand out. We excluded, colleges, certifications, and volunteer experience. Only the ""about"" and experience section was used. You can probably guess we used Clay for everything. 

1. We used pulled their most recent LinkedIn post and used that as the trigger. Then we talked about how we checked out their company. 

Hey John, I saw you recent post about your companies work with micro influencers. Dug a little deeper on your profile and saw you help connect influencers with brands looking to grow on social. 

2. If we couldn't detect a LinkedIn post, we called out something about their profile summary/work experience that was notable. Large company transitions, accomplishments, impacts on businesses they work with. etc. We still transitioned with what their company does to have a good segue.

Hey Roger, I was checking out your profile and kind of couldn't believe that you helped do the coding for the Bloomberg terminal from the ""Big Short"" movie. Dug a little deeper on your profile and saw you help activate VOIP numbers for platforms. 

And I know the anti personalization crowd is going to hate this, but it significantly increased response rates when we personalized the email. (11 positive responses when no personalization was present).

urn:li:activity:7100117488222224384,"Here are 7 ways to personalize your cold emails based on someone's LinkedIn profile. 

Falling back onto a LinkedIn profile personalization is super easy to do in Clay because the tool allows you to input a whole LinkedIn profile into GPT-4. As always, focus on relevance instead of just personalization. These are meant to be what you can do after no other data is found.

All prompts can be found in the comments where I'll post the video. 

1. Infer how someone could be open to new ideas. Credit to Jordan Crawford

We can use GPT-4 to find something on a person's profile that makes us think they might be open to new ideas because hey, we are about to pitch them a new idea. 

Example Output

I saw on LinkedIn you've moved from supervisor to Head of Biologics? Guess you're into new challenges.

2. Call out their Alma Mater. 

An oldie, but not necessarily a goodie. I'm not a huge fan of this personalization because it is rather trite. I added my own twist on to the prompt to look at what years they attended and to ask if they were there when something newsworthy took place. 

Example Output

Noticed you went to Rutgers. Were you there when they opened the new business school building in New Brunswick?

3. Location Based line

Use AI to call out a notable landmark, fun thing to do, or great restaurant in the area. (Honestly, I'd save this and the college one as P.S. lines)

Example Output

I was on LinkedIn and noticed you're based in DFW. Ever visited the iconic Reunion Tower for a panoramic city view?

4. Sniffing for Uniqueness

You can use AI to try to find something unique about a person. I literally prompted it to find something they would be complimented on at a dinner party. 

Example output

I saw on LinkedIn, you've climbed the ranks at big tech firms like Zoom and Cisco, especially in Latin America.

5. Call out how long they have been in their department

Calling out how long someone has been at a company is easy. Calling out their experience in marketing is way more fun. 

Example output

I saw on LinkedIn you've been in Clinical Operations for over 15 years.

6. Call out something newsworthy at their past experience

Analyze their past company experience and call out something newsworthy during their tenure. 

Example Output

I saw on LinkedIn that in the past you worked at Reznick Group. Did you experience the CohnReznick merger while you were there?

7. A line to talk explain why I'm reaching out

With this line, we take into account their job title, what their company does, and what my company does. Trying to combine ""poking the bear"" with ""why you, why now"" credit: John Barrows / Josh Braun

Example Output

I saw you lead the sales team so I figured I'd reach out. Are you automating your account research or are reps still checking things manually.

What people are looking for is a test to see if a personalized email would beat a generic email template at scale. Finally, I have some proof to shed on the topic.

One of my customers with Growth Engine X clocked in with 176 positive responses in a 3 month period. 

Every email we sent was personalized with a particular problem we found about the cart on their e-commerce site. 

Recently, we got to the bottom of the barrel where we couldn't detect the issue and figured we would send emails generically to test if we needed the personalization. Same volume, exact same message except it doesn't include the data point. Result?

1 positive response in the last week. 

Do I think the manually personalizing every single message is necessary in the world of GPT-4? Absolutely not

Do I think that sending out a generic email to everyone is the answer? This might be even worse. 

Think about what is the message that you would send if you had 10 minutes to research a prospect. What are you researching? Why? What do you find and how does that change your messaging? 

Then think how could you scale this with live data scrapes, tools like Clay, and GPT-4?

2ã Prospeo.io
Why I use it: After finding the right domains, I use Prospeo to pull all emails connected to them.

Pros: Finds both generic (info@) and professional (e.g. emily@company.com) emails Most emails come pre-validated.

Cons: Doesnt provide names or job titles. Even professional emails can lack context.

Workaround: I use Claygent to reverse search names and roles tied to those email addresses.

3ã Claygent
Why I use it: Claygent fills in the missing details. 

Pros: Finds full name, job title, and LinkedIn profile. Pulls data beyond LinkedIn, sourcing across the web.

Useful for building large, detailed lead lists especially for local businesses.

Cons: Email validity is often low. You might get the right person, but not the right contact info

Workaround:
 I use Claygent to get the right people and pair it with Prospeo, LeadMagic, Icypeas, FullEnrich, to validate and find working emails.

You filter by industry.

Add headcount.

And somehow... you get 18 results.
Or 4,000  but its a messy mix of real prospects and your competitors.
All because the keyword tags are too broad.

You try to sell to law firms.
But the ones in Apollo are either too big, too small, or missing completely.

You target HVAC companies.
But most of what shows up isnt even in your region.

You go after local restaurants.
But all you see are giant chains  not the independents you actually want.

So what happens?

Your reps spend hours on Google.
Manually checking maps, sites, and social.
Pasting it all into spreadsheets.

They were hired to sell.
But theyre stuck doing research.

2 replies out of 1,000.

Because trust is everything.

When companies make big claims without real proof, it damages their credibility and undermines the relationships theyre trying to build.

At < oneaway >, honesty and transparency are the foundation of every relationship we build. 

Its not about what we say, but about what we prove.

Thats why we have real video testimonials on our website  from real people, with real results. 

No exaggerations. No empty promises.

Trust is earned through actions, not flashy claims.

What made this campaign work wasnt a complex, multi-step workflow. No fancy automation. No over-engineered sequences.

Just cold email and the right variables.

All we had to do was find the right variables for the copy:

 Emphasize their pain point ’ triggers urgency & need
 Name-drop their competitor ’ triggers FOMO
 Mention their neighborhood ’ builds familiarity
 Mention their product category ’ feels personal
 Reference something from their website ’ shows realistic intent
 Mention that we saw them in a marketplace or platform ’ proves relevance

And use minimal amount of sales stack:
Clay
ZenRows
LeadMagic
Prospeo.io
ChatGPT
Instantly.ai

And honestly, as an Asian, I have a bit of a cheapskate mindset =

Getting real results with minimal tools? Thats peak satisfaction for me.

I remember when I was an SDRgetting this kind of data took forever. 

Now, with just one tool like Clay, you can build this in an hour.

The key takeaway? 

When a client has strong product-market fit, outbound doesnt need to be complicated. 

The product already sells itselfwe just had to put them in front of the right people with the right message.

Too often, outbound teams do double dutydriving leads while also figuring out PMF. 

Thats a tough game, but we also have a case study for that one.

Lately, Ive been getting a lot of messages asking:

 ""Can you give me honest feedback on Clay?""
""Do you know a Clay consultant who can help?""

But heres the problemmost dont actually know what they need.

Some are hiring a Clay Operatorsomeone who knows how to use Clay, but thats it.

Others need a GTM Engineersomeone who understands Clay, automation, and execution.

And a few are really looking for a GTM Architecta strategist who connects all the dots across positioning, growth, and systems.

#1 mistake? Thinking one person can do it all.

Heres how to break it down:
« Clay Operator ’ Knows Clay. Can build clay workflows but doesnt think beyond execution.
« GTM Engineer ’ Knows Clay, automation, and execution. Turns GTM strategy into action.
« GTM Architect ’ Visionary & strategist. Defines GTM motion, positioning, and growth strategy.

Do you need oneor all three in one person?

Too many teams hire a Clay expert expecting them to be a GTM strategist. Thats a fast track to frustration.

Before hiring, ask yourself:

- Do I just need Clay workflows built?(Clay Operator)
- Do I need someone to automate and execute a GTM motion? (GTM Engineer)
- Do I need a full GTM strategy + execution? (GTM Architect + Engineer)

Clay is powerfulbut its only a tool. The real impact comes from whos using it and how.

Yet, some leaders still think low cost = low value.

Heres the truth:

¡ Talent isnt cheapits just overlooked.
¡ Hard work doesnt have a locationbut bias does.
¡ If you judge people by their paycheck, youre missing out on top talent.

-Companies that prioritize diversity are 35% more likely to outperform competitors. The best teams come from everywhere, not just one country.
-Half of todays workforce will need to upskill by 2025. Global professionals are not just keeping uptheyre leading the way.

Ive seen professionals from across the world outthink, outwork, and outperform their first-world counterparts.

Now, youve been thinking about it...

Should you scale your SDR team, hire your first SDR, or bring in a GTM Engineer?

For context: GTM Engineer = the new SDR in 2025 (AI, Clay, and automation).

Heres a breakdown:

5 BDRs ($331K/year)
³ Expensive to hire and train
³ Takes months to ramp up
³ 100% focused on your company
³ With good leadership, they can become great

1 Clay-Agency (1/5th of the cost)
³ Not fully focused on you (they have other clients)
³ Can feel less personal (depends)
³ Works like 5+ BDRs for much less money
³ Results come quicklyusually within the first month

Clay + SDRs (Best of both worlds)
³ AI-equipped SDRs can run bulk data enrichment and focus on ICP-qualified leads
³ Lets SDRs focus on cold calls and creating content
³ Removes manual, boring tasks like list building and updating CRMs

Early stage: If youre proving PMF or building your pipeline, a Clay agency is the best option. 

Once your pipeline is healthy, hire your first BDR or, better yet, a GTM Engineer.

Later stage: Dont replace your BDRs. 

Use a Clay agency to coach them and remove manual work, so they can focus on the 3% of leads ready to buy.

Thats when PandaMatch =< entered the picture.

So here Im sharing the top 6 features of PandaMatch that helped me:

7 Domain Search - You can select up to 10 specific domains that are lookalikes of your target prospects.

7 Keyword Search - Add keywords to narrow down your search to the most relevant matches.

7 Exact Search - Use exact word/s to get only the website with this exact phrase/s.

7 Description Search - Focus on descriptions to identify prospects that align with the clients niche.

7 Negative Search - Exclude irrelevant domain, keyword, description, or exact words to keep your results clean and on point

7 Minimum and Maximum Score - Set scoring ranges to target either target smaller businesses or larger companies.

Bonus: Hands-on customer support! 

PandaMatch helped me do what no other tool could, find quality prospects in a niche even Apollo and LinkedIn couldnt touch.

How do I know this wont be another waste of time and money?

Fair. Outbound isnt magic, its strategy, persistence, and relentless testing.

The first 2 months were about laying the groundwork:
 Testing personas
 Refining subject lines and openers
 Reworking offers and CTAs

But it wasnt until Balsa Kosic and Chizoba Anyasie, stepped in and reimagined the playbook that things clicked.

By month 3, the results spoke for themselves:
7 12 leads in a single day
7 A reply from a major industry leader
7 A deal now worth six figures

Why SKOs Matter More Than Ever:

œ Set the tone for the year

A great SKO gives the team clarity on priorities and a roadmap for success.

œ Bring teams together

Its a chance to reconnect, align, and build stronger relationships for the year ahead.

œ Inspire action

The best SKOs leave teams energized with clear, actionable strategies they can use right away.

Heres the exact playbook:

1ã Scraped business data: We used Clay and Serper to extract targeted leads from Google Maps 

(in case you're wondering why not use native integration of Google reviews? this is why: Serper costs $0.0001 per lead) 

2ã Enriched with reviews: Pulled Google Reviews data using Apify, zooming in on newest and lowest ratings.

3ã Hyper-personalized outreach: Leveraged Clay formulas to segment leads based on outreach angles and used ChatGPT to craft hyper-personalized lines for each segment.

4ã Effortless launch: Deployed the campaign via Instantly.ai to kick off outreach at scale.

The results?

7 A campaign that wouldve taken me a week to build as an SDR was launched in a single day.

Why it worked:

urn:li:activity:7271889243948355584,"4 months ago, I was an SDR.

Every other post on my feed said:
The SDR role is dead. 

Instead of panicking, I knew I had to move fast.

Thank goodness I was active on LinkedIn.

Ive seen how quickly the sales space evolves.

A year ago, lemlist was everywhere.

Now? Its all about Clay.

The SDR role isnt dead ’ but its feels cursed in 2024.
â You book meetings.
â You hit quota (sometimes).
â And you hope& for an AE promotion.

But lets be honest, its a game of luck. <²

â Your territory or manager can make or break your shot.
â No control. No guarantees.

So, If not AE, then what?

I started looking into GTM roles.

People call it ""GTM Engineer."" You play with tools like Clay, automate workflows, and actually drive results.

Fast forward to now - Im with < oneaway >, helping companies do just that.

Heres the truth:

If youre a BDR, you have two choices:
¡ Move to AE and hope for the best.
¡ Or move into GTM and build your future.

The BDR role doesnt have to be a dead end.

But escaping it? Thats on you.

Move fast. Move smart. ó

Whats your next move AE or GTM?

urn:li:activity:7267851204666241025,"Its tempting to think automation can handle everything  especially in cold outreach.

Why not let a system send emails, book meetings, and close deals for you?

But heres the truth: You dont want that.

> Automation works best at the top of the funnel.

When leads are skimming emails, automation gets the job done. They just need to see, Whats in it for me?

> When a lead replies? Thats when things change.

Heres where most outreach systems fail: They dont teach you when to go manual.

A reply isnt just data. Its a sign that someone is interested in what you have to say.

Š Send a real message.
‹ Look them up on LinkedIn.
Œ Take 5 minutes to record a Loom.

Why?
> People buy from people.

Not bots.
Everyone is automating everything. By doing the opposite, you stand out.

¢ Your effort builds trust.
¢ Your effort shows them youre serious.

The rule is simple:

If someone is interested in you, theyve earned a real response.
Dont over-automate. Be human where it matters.

urn:li:activity:7267474340474957824,"5 BDRs for $331K per year or 1 Clay-Agency for 1/5th of the cost? Lets have a look at the pros and cons =G

L Cons of 5 BDRs
7 Expensive.
7 Most of the time, the BDRs are inexperienced.
7 It takes 3-6 months to fully onboard a BDR and they are often a reflection of the person in charge of them.

<Æ Pros of 5 BDRs
7 They spend 100% of their time only thinking about you. (a huge plus btw)
7 With good leadership, you can mould them into the perfect salesperson for your team.
7 1 BDR who practices your company values can help you scale and grow an A+ Team.

L Cons of Clay-gencies
7 You are not their main focus, they have other clients.
7 Because of that, on the surface, they feel expensive.
7 You feel blinded because they own the outbound process.

<Æ Pros of Clay-gencies
7 They are up to date on the latest sales tech.
7 They can operate like 5+ BDRs for a fraction of the cost.
7 You can start seeing results with them within the first month.

Okay, now thats out of the way 2 important notes to make:

1- If youre an early-stage company looking to either prove PMF or get enough users/clients to see a healthier MRR, then a Clay agency is a better fit.

Its a lower risk on your end with higher upside. Use an Agency until your pipeline is looking healthy and then start hiring your first BDR/Sales person.

(Ideally someone who is up to date with the latest tech though)

2- If youre a later-stage company, youre better off hiring a clay agency to consult and coach your BDRs OR to remove the manual work from their hands, but NOT replace them.

Instead, coach your BDRs on creating content online and let them put in the manual work towards following up with the 3% of the market that are interested instead of chasing after the 97% of the market that isnt ready to buy.

TLDR;
7 The BDR role is evolving, start creating content and spend your time following up with interested leads generated by Clay workflows.
7 Early stage > Clay-gency - Later stage > BDRs empowered by Clay
7 Everything works, nothing works.

That kind of feedback? It really makes my day >p

So& why do I keep posting? Is it because:

Ï Xavier Caffrey (our CEO) is pushing us to do it?
Ï Im trying to get inbound leads?
Ï Im building my personal brand?
Ï Or would I get penalized if I stopped posting?

The answer:

Ï Xaviers not forcing anything and definitely not micromanaging our content (hes chill like that).
Ï Yeah, I get some inbound leads, but not all are great. Plus, being in the Philippines, some people think Ill work for lower rate and deliver gold (another stereotype for another day).
Ï Sure, I want to grow my personal brand, but thats not the only reason.
Ï And no, I wont get in trouble if I skipped posting. =

So why do I keep at it?

` It helped me grow my confidence.
a It taught me discipline and consistency.
b I can see how much Im improving over time.
c And honestly, posting is kind of like keeping a journal, a digital one.

urn:li:ugcPost:7261646693174001664,"Why are some companies choosing outbound agencies over BDRs?

7 Heres a breakdown of whats driving the shift:

1ã Faster results
Agencies come in with tried-and-tested playbooks and start producing results within weeks, not months. 

No long ramp-up times or waiting to see if a BDR will work out.

2ã Scalable outreach
Agencies send high-quality, personalized emails at scale. 

While a BDR can only handle so much, agencies reach thousands while still keeping it relevant.

3ã Proven strategy
Agencies work across industries, learning what sticks. 

They dont just send emails; they bring data-backed strategies that deliver results.

4ã Agile testing
Agencies go beyond typical A/B tests, using modern stacks to adapt quickly, fine-tuning messaging faster to get the right fit sooner.

5ã Tech-Stack expertise
Agencies bring optimized, constantly updated tech stacks so you dont need to invest in new tools. 

You get the best of outreach tech without the integration headaches.

6ã Built-In experience
BDRs often need time and training to ramp up, but agencies come with seasoned pros whove honed their strategies over years of data-driven work.

7ã Cost Efficiency
With economies of scale, agencies can bring down tech costs and offer lower rates for outreach, saving thousands without sacrificing quality.

To be fair, though, I know some folks havent had the best experience with outbound agencies. 

So, make sure theyre not just experts on LinkedIn.

They need to show real results. 

And keep in mind, first month might be full of A/B testing and tweaks to get it right but still a pretty much faster ramp than scaling your sales team.

Its all about the right approach. 

First, use Clay to scrape key data, then let GPT help you create personalized lines that grab attention.

Next, Come up with 3 variations for this section. Essentially ask 3 questions about 3 problems that the lead typically goes through. 

Describe what you do in 20 words or less, keep it sharp.

’ Keep signatures simple
Phone numbers or big logos in your signature can tank deliverability. Less is more.

’ Watch your words
Words like Free, Urgent, and Limited Time trigger spam filters. Avoid them.

’ Diversify sending domains
Relying only on Gmail and Outlook? Add more inboxes to improve reach.

’ Mind your copy
Spam-trigger words hurt your domain. Keep it clear, conversational, and dynamic.

Segmentation: ³ Craft messaging tailored to each segment to increase relevance.

Automate Data Enrichment: ³ Use tools like Clay to enrich and scrape lead data faster. 

Balance Your Life:

Mental Health: ³ Dont tie your worth to KPIs, separate performance from self-value.

Accountability: ³ A/B test, track progress, and keep improving.

Feedback Loops: ³ Constantly refine based on whats working and what isnt.

Job Satisfaction: ³ Every task completed brings you closer to your goal.

If I had to pick one reason why you should be using instantly and why we implement it for all of our clients is because&

it is (unequivocally) the best option on the market right now to hit your desired email sending volume without breaking the bank.

What other instantly features do you like?

1ã LinkedIn content
7 Post 4x weekly
7 Set aside 30 minutes daily to engage with others in community
7 Send a warm message to your ICP who engaged with your content to start a conversation

2ã Cold Email
7 Get a clean list of your ICPs email via Prospeo
7 Scrape relevant data to structure a targeted email with Clay
7 Warm-up emails for 2 weeks and launch cold email campaign with Instantly.ai

3ã Upwork
7 Create a detailed project listing outlining your outreach services
7 Proactively send proposals to clients looking for sales support
7 Build long-term relationships by over-delivering on your first project and requesting reviews

Upwork is unique because clients are actively searching for solutions like yours. Instead of just relying on outbound, you can let prospects come to you while showcasing your expertise.

4ã Reddit, Inc.
7 Join relevant subreddits
7 Share experiments on Reddit and match the platforms tone
7 Send direct messages to people who engage with your content and disqualify them asap

This is a very rough breakdown of the 4 channels, but the sooner you get started, the bigger the gap is going to be between you and your competition.

Youre one channel away from changing the trajectory of your business.

PS: We signed 2 clients from posting content on Reddit! Who else is on the Reddit content game?

Started watching free resources on YouTube by Eric Nowoslawski, Hans Dekker, Patrick Spychalski, Cody Carnes, and more.

Joined communities like Clay Cafe Kellen Casebeer, OneAway community by Xavier Caffrey.

Subscribed to newsletter by David Emanuel Moreira & >ÉMarcos Stubrin, Clay Wizards by Michael Saruggia, Automindz Solutions by Niklas Huetzen, Claymation by Alex Lindahl.

Until I came across ClayMBA, one of the verified partners of Clay that are providing courses.

It definitely helped me go from basic understanding to more advanced concepts and methods like learning how Webhooks, custom APIs, and formulas work.

There's just so much use cases and possibilities.

I'm still at 31% of the course, so there's still a lot to learn and practice, definitely there will be a learning curve.

By next year, if you want to land a sales or GTM role, you will need to submit a loom of you building a Clay table.

I took the plunge into LinkedIn posting back in February - I cringed every time I hit ""post"", wondering if my insights were actually valuable or just noise. 

Who was I to share my thoughts and experiences here? Would anyone even care what I had to say?

So I started small - posting when inspiration struck, sharing a little backstory about myself, writing about my company's products, or discussing trends in my niche.

But I'm proud to say I've stuck with it, and here are a few things I've learned after 3 months of awkward posting:

1. Don't rely on motivation or inspiration to post - there will be days you hate it. Just push through. The momentum will come.

2. Even if you only get a few impressions at first, keep engaging and building relationships. Don't get discouraged. 

3. Share more of your personal story and humor. Don't just post about your product and expertise. People connect with personality. 

4. Consistency matters more than individual post performance, especially early on. Keep going even with low engagement. 

Now I'm seeing a bit of momentum in my posting strategy (still trying). But it took persistence through the cringe phase to get here!

So don't be afraid to put yourself out there on LinkedIn. 

Yes, it's uncomfortable at first. But in the long run, it's so worth it for your personal brand and career opportunities.

When did you start posting on LinkedIn and what motivated you? 

I'd love to hear your story in the comments!

That's 12.5 hours per week stuck in traffic! No wonder remote work is becoming so popular here. 

As Cris Odeca mentioned in her recent post, many Filipinos actively seek out permanent work-from-home roles to avoid the daily commute grind. 

I'm one of the lucky ones who found a remote position. Without a soul-sucking daily commute, I have so much more energy to be creative and productive in my work. 

But remote work isn't for everyone. 

Some people thrive on in-person social interaction and prefer the structure of a traditional office environment. 

While freelancing requires a strong entrepreneurial spirit that not all employees possess. There are pros and cons to every work setup.

At the end of the day, having the flexibility to choose our work arrangement based on our individual needs and preferences is what matters most. 

The option to work remotely has been life-changing for me. But I recognize it may not be the best fit for others.

These groups have massive reach and influence, making them invaluable partners for startups looking to get traction. 

For example, video editing platform VEED.IO attracted tons of creators by offering an intuitive, high-quality editing experience. 

These creators shared Veed-edited content far and wide, rapidly growing its userbase. 

Veed gave creators an amazing product, and creators gave Veed viral growth. It was a perfect match.

AI tools are especially well-positioned to capitalize on this creator-driven growth, especially now that there's some FOMO feeling when it comes to adapting to AI.

So if you're a new tech product, think strategically about how to get creators onboard. 

The key is to identify relevant influencers, analyze their audience potential, and calculate their true value. 

Our influencer marketing software does this automatically, finding creators with the highest conversion rates for your brand.

In the end, leveraging influencers provides built-in distribution and validation. 

It's a proven way for new products to accelerate growth by engaging communities.

It's such an incredible feeling to see our efforts paying off and making a difference.

But before I dive into that, let me tell you a little backstory about the company I'm proud to be a part of - Dreamwell AI!! 

Our CEO, Kazzy, he used to be a full-time YouTuber with 460,000 subscribers. 

But he saw something - the brokenness of the influencer marketing industry.

So, Kazzy teamed up with our brilliant CTO, Anthony. 

This guy's a legend - he led API development at Instacart and built Ad Parlor with a team of over 15 engineers! 

Together, they embarked on a mission to revolutionize influencer marketing.

Enter Dreamwell - a platform designed specifically for marketers like you, who want to turn influencers into their most profitable acquisition channel. 

It's about optimizing campaigns, driving real results, and changing the game.

urn:li:activity:7173271564803649536,"Starting out as an SDR in early-stage startups can be challenging due to resource constraints that limit access to sales tools and training.

(I know this because I was once with a startup in APAC, no CRM, running email campaigns using mail merge, I left after one week because I didn't know better =-)

Unlike established companies, there may not be significant budgets allocated for these essentials.

However, in such situations, SDRs can thrive by leveraging creativity, resourcefulness, and self-learning.

Sales tools are vital for SDR success.

They streamline processes, enhance productivity, and provide insights crucial for effective prospecting.

Without a robust sales tech stack, SDRs face various pain points.

Manual data entry, lack of lead insights, and inefficient prospecting methods hinder progress, making the sales journey akin to sailing without a compass.

SDRs can explore alternative methods to engage prospects effectively, relying on resourcefulness to make the most of limited resources.

If this is you, here are free tools you can use for free, they have free and paid version:
Apollo.io - lead research
HubSpot - CRM
Clay - data enrichment

While sales tools are indispensable, they don't solely define SDR success.

Connect with peers to stay informed and adapt to industry trends.

If you're an SDR facing resource constraints, remember, you're not alone.

3. AI Content on the rise: With the rise of AI-generated content, the LinkedIn landscape is bustling.

But in this vast ocean of noise, where everyone claims to offer the best services, it's easy to get lost along the way.


The good news? I've found something special - balance >9

Balance means I can make time for work and still do fun stuff, like hanging out. 

My job is important, but so is spending time with my parents.

They're always there to help and support me, even when we're just doing regular stuff like going to the grocery store.

We chat about the day and have a good laugh together.

Those little moments mean a lot to me.

They remind me to enjoy what I have and appreciate the simple things in life.

Plus, being Filipino, I really value the close ties in our culture. 

Family is big deal, and I'm grateful for the support and love that surrounds me.

So, here's to my sales adventure, full of ups and downs but always exciting.

And here's to finding balance in everything, whether working hard or having fun with the people we love. 

In this big adventure called life, it's the small things that matter most.

How do you see work-life balance in your life?

urn:li:activity:7166801384867086336,"Here's a strategy for picking the best email finder for your business:

1. Think about what you need the most. 

Do you need a lot of emails quickly? Or do you need really accurate emails, even if it takes a bit longer? 

Knowing what you need will help you pick the right tool.

2. Check out the options. 

There are different email finders out there, look for reviews and ask other people in your industry what they use. 

Sometimes, hearing from other people can give you a good idea of what might work best for you.

3. Consider your budget too. 

Some email finders might be more expensive than others. 

Make sure you're getting good value for what you pay.

4. Try before you buy. 

Many email finders offer free trials or demos. 

Take advantage of these to see if the tool works well for you and your business.

5. Consider customer support.

If you run into problems or have questions, good customer support can be a lifesaver. 

Look for email finders that offer responsive customer service to help you when you need it.

6, Check for compliance.

Ensure that the email finder you choose is compliant with data protection regulations like GDPR. 

You want to make sure your use of the tool is legal and ethical.

By following these steps, you can find the best email finder for your business needs. 

If you're an SDR for a startup like me, we might do a lot of A/B testing to really see which tools work for your org.

Just remember to think about what's important to the team, do your research, and give it a test run before you make a decision.

When I'm looking for other tools, I always check ColdIQ's list of Sales Prospecting Tools.

It all started when I saw my animated picture drawn by an artist a few months ago.

It felt special, like capturing a part of myself in a digital world.

As I look at that picture now, it makes me think about how much things have changed, especially for artists and creators like graphic designers and illustrators.

AI, has become a big part of how we create things.

For graphic designers and illustrators, AI tools have opened up new possibilities.

They can now create amazing designs and illustrations faster and with more precision than ever before.

But it's not just about making things easier.

AI is also changing the way we think about art.

It's raising questions about what it means to be creative and where the line is between human ideas and machine work.

And then there's Sora, a new tool for video editors that uses AI to help them make videos.

But what does all of this mean for artists and creators?

It means that we're living in an exciting time, where technology is opening up new possibilities for us to explore and create.

So as we look to the future, let's remember to keep our minds open and our creativity alive.

Here's to the artists, the creators, and the dreamers  may we continue to explore, create, and imagine together.

Here's the scoop:

Imagine sailing without a destination in mind. 

You might drift along, but you'll never reach new shores.

That's where goals come in.

They give you direction, purpose, and something to strive for.

Whether it's landing your dream job, starting a business, or mastering a new skill, goals give your life structure and meaning.

But wait, there's more:

Goals aren't just about the endgame; they're about the journey.

They push you to grow, to learn, and to become the best version of yourself.

Think of them as stepping stones toward your ultimate vision.

And here's the kicker:

Setting goals isn't just reserved for big dreams, it's about tackling the everyday challenges too.

From waking up early to hitting the gym, every goal, big or small, moves you closer to your aspirations.

So, why is setting goals important?

Because they light the path ahead, fuel your passion, and propel you toward a future filled with purpose and fulfillment.

urn:li:activity:7163169996737605632,"Ever wondered why some emails hit the mark while others end up in the digital abyss?

It's all about personalization.

Let's break it down:

Imagine sending out generic emails to your listno personal touch, just a one-size-fits-all approach. Sure, some might open it, but most will hit delete faster than you can say ""spam.""

But here's where personalization swoops in like a superhero.

By tailoring your emails to speak directly to your audience's needs, preferences, and pain points, you're grabbing their attention in a crowded inbox.

Think about it:

When was the last time you opened an email that felt like it was written just for you?

Personalization isn't just about slapping a name on the subject line; it's about understanding your audience on a deeper level.

It's about using their past behavior, interests, and demographics to craft messages that resonate.

And guess what?

When your audience feels understood, they're more likely to open, click, and engage.

It's like having a secret weapon in your email marketing arsenal.

So, here's the deal:
If you want to skyrocket your open rates, dive deep into personalization.

Craft emails that feel like they were made for each subscriber individually.

Watch as your open rates soar, your engagement spikes, and your audience becomes more loyal than ever before =è=€

urn:li:activity:7163133931880448002,"Stop underestimating the power of influencer marketing.

It's not just about flashy posts or trendy hashtags.

It's a strategic move that can catapult brands into the spotlight and drive real engagement.

Think about it:

Influencers have built dedicated communities around their content.

Their followers trust them, value their opinions, and hang on their every word.

When an influencer promotes a product or service, it's like a personal recommendation from a friend.

And that's gold for brands.

Influencer marketing isn't just about reaching a wide audience; it's about reaching the right audience.

These influencers have already done the hard work of identifying and connecting with a target demographic.

By partnering with them, brands can tap into those existing relationships and gain instant credibility.

But here's the real magic:

Influencer marketing isn't one-size-fits-all.

There are different types of influencers, each with their own unique strengths and audience reach.

From micro-influencers with niche followings to mega-celebrities with millions of fans, brands have a spectrum of options to choose from.

And the significance?

It's all about authenticity and resonance.

In today's cluttered digital landscape, consumers are bombarded with ads and promotions at every turn.

But influencer marketing cuts through the noise by delivering content that feels genuine and relatable.

It's about storytelling, creating connections, and fostering brand loyalty.
Influencers have the power to humanize brands, making them more approachable and trustworthy in the eyes of consumers.

So, next time you think influencer marketing is just a passing trend, think again.

It's a strategic powerhouse that savvy brands are leveraging to stay relevant, connect with audiences, and drive meaningful results!

Welcome to the realm of personal branding, your beacon in the digital wilderness.

Personal branding is the art of curating and projecting a distinctive image of oneself to the world.

In today's hyper-connected landscape, it's not just a choice; it's a strategic necessity.

It's not just about self-promotion, it's about showcasing your authentic self and what sets you apart.

In a nutshell, personal branding is your ticket to stand out, be remembered, and leave a legacy in a world that's constantly scrolling.

During the interviews, we showed candidates a screenshot of campaign results: 

’ 41% Open Rate
’ 0.8% Reply Rate
’ 26% Positive Replies
’ 50% Turned into Meetings
 
""Tell me what you see and what you would improve"" I asked. Some answered shocked me.

- ""The open rate of 40% is pretty strong"" 
- 
- ""Reply rate of 0.8% is OK but can be better. I'd test the messaging and the CTA""
- 
- ""Positive Reply rate is rather bad. I'd create better personalization using sales signals"" 

That was not just one candidate. The majority of them answered like that. 

Do BDRs and RevOps really have ZERO understanding how these numbers connect? 

Not knowing this cost a customer 100,000 in MRR. They were sending 3,000 emails a day and had an open rate of 38%. 

""Lanny, we need clay to create hyperpersonalized emails""

""Maybe"" I said. ""but this is not your main issue. You're fixing the WRONG thing. If nobody reads your emails, it does not matter how personalized they are""

After fixing their deliverability, they DOUBLED their pipeline in 6 weeks. 

Simple truth: If you're fixing the wrong issue, you're wasting time & money.

Here's how to understand & fix your KPIs:  

1.) Open Rate < 60% 
Means your emails are ending up in spam. The problem is your sending setup - NOT the messaging. 

’ Stop tracking it (it's inaccurate and harmful) 
’ Setup multiple domains & inboxes
’ Set up your DKIM, SPF, DMARC
’ 15 emails per inbox / day 
’ Use spintax. 

Smartlead is the # 1 tool that fixes all of this. 

2.) Reply rate < 1%
This also a deliverability issue, not copywriting ’ same fixes as above

3.) Reply rate < 5-10%
People just don't care about your message. You're either targeting the wrong people or your message is too vanilla. 

Here's the fix: 
’ Short messaging (less than 100 words, 6th-grade English) 
’ A/B test different value propositions
’ Be hyperspecific about the problem
’ Create smaller target audiences 

4.) Positive Reply Rate < 20-25%
Most responses are either ""no thanks"" or ""we already have a solution"" instead of a ""hell YES"". 

’The problem statement is a scratch, not a broken bone
’ Offer sounds generic / not different
’ Your solution is a ""nice-to-have""

Fix this with hyperpersonlized lead magnet/engagement offers and ""sell"" the next step. 

Why should someone meet with you? (Starbucks gift cards aren't it)

5.) Meetings booked <75%

And it's not lead magnet post, it's fully organic without any hacks. 

BACKGROUND

Over the last 12 months, LinkedIn has become the KEY to our lead gen.
It makes everything easier

’ Meetings come inbound 
’ People know already what we do 
’ They are VERY problem aware and want help

Winning deals is so much easier.

But that was not always the case.

For YEARS I struggled with content generation. I always ""knew"" that I should do it, but had the usual struggles:

My target audience did not care about my content (only my competitors did)

1. I didn't know what to post about
2. didn't have time to post
3. I always got started with 1,2,3 posts and then stopped again.

Here's exactly what changed my LinkedIn approach:

1.) Created an AI Agent that produces 90% of my content

Being diagnosed with ADD, I get distracted easily. Writing posts felt impossible with my scattered focus.

So I created an agent that: 

’ Drafts content based on the best performing posts on LinkedIn 
’ Is trained on my unique knowledge & story 
’ Has a QA agent that improves the drafts 
’ Creates multiple variations to test

Now content creation isn't on my mental to-do list anymore. It happens automatically in the background.

I just review the posts on Monday morning for 30 minutes.

2.) Automatically fed all my sales calls to the agent

This was the breakthrough. This makes sure my content feels ""real"" and personal and does not sound like AI. 

I recorded 30+ discovery calls, transcribed them, and gave the agent access to every word.

Now it knows: 
’ Specific phrases they use to describe problems 
’ Exact pain points our prospects mention 
’ Questions they're actually asking

People literally told me in the calls: ""Your post was reading my mind"". 

That's because it was. 

3.) Focus on what CROs & Sales VPs care about

I used to get a lot of engagement from the wrong guys. Lead Gen agencies that just wanted to grab the latest tactics. 

So I moved away from tactical and technical ""how-to"" posts. 

Instead, I focus only on strategic issues: 

’ How to reduce headcount while hitting sales targets
’ Ways to lower customer acquisition costs 
’ Moving away from traditional outreach

Now decision-makers engage instead of GTM gurus.

RESULTS

Our revenue in Q1 2025.

I paused ALL LinkedIn posting AND outreach campaigns. 

Too many qualified leads, not enough capacity to serve them.

TAKEAWAY

As founders, we're too busy to ""do LinkedIn properly.""

That's why we need systems that do it for us.

Your customers are already telling you what content to create in every 
sales call.

You just need a system to capture those insights and turn them into content.

urn:li:activity:7328075328289914880,"The last 2 months, I had to turn clients away. We were at max capacity and needed to hire. This cost us $50,000 in revenue. People from Salesforce and BIG competitors applied. Here's how we attract & hire absolute A-Players:

BACKGROUND

Our mission is simple. We want to change how B2B go to market. 

Less Humans. More AI.

Faster. Better. Cheaper.

We use AI agents to do most of our work. That's why we can make over 
100k with only 1 person working with clients.

But to reach 200k a month, we needed more hands.

So we started looking for an A-Player Go-To-Market Engineer. 

In 2 weeks we had top-tier people applying: 
’ GTM Engineers/Account managers from big competitors 
’ Lead Gen Agency Owners 
’ Salesforce AEs

Out of 153 applications, we interviewed 29. Only 3 made it to the final round. And now we found him: Pablo Ferrer

He crushed the interview case. He came up with solutions we never even thought of.

And that's what we need. People who raise the bar.

He already had his own agency. But he gave it up. Why?

He wanted to be part of something bigger and work with the best. 

So how are we able to attract such talented people that work in some of the best companies in the world and give up on their own dreams? 

The same reason why we're fully booked with clients: 

Our brand. 

People know us from LinkedIn. They see we're the top 1% in the GTM space. And they want to join us. 

As clients, As team members.

We had people saying: ""I'm super happy where I am now. But I've been following you for months and your Allbound Approach is EXACTLY what the market needs. I want to be part of that""

At least 1 or 2 times a week, I tell a client to start posting on LinkedIn. 
It's a cheat code. For more clients and better people. 
It's growth flywheel. Yet only few act on it. 

There's an old saying: ""if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, bring others along.""

With Pablo on board, we go faster AND further.

One of his KPIs is to share his deep expertise on LinkedIn.

And he gets a cash bonus if he hits his numbers.

Go give Pablo Ferrer a follow if you want me to lose some money (and have an even happier team member).",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7328075328289914880,,3 weeks ago,lanny-heiz,ACoAABrwydgBQ_qD2JKjaDpeGZaghHDvJpTIGh8,Lanny M.,Heiz (,Using AI to create a Full Sales Pipeline without big BDR teams( Clay Enterprise Partner | Founder @ Enablement.ch,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQGpZoz78NNXZQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1687284271466?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=kxmd5kRmU5wSKlq3AVphOcXUIkVXqu2Dg0iLfiNIYtA,1.0,4.0,,,,True,No,No,No

BACKGROUND

1 month ago Gilbert Kralinger DM me on Slack: ""We need to talk. You can't just keep closing 100k a month. We need to change something NOW. Otherwise, we never make it to 200k a month."" 

So I did what every good sales leader would do. 

I closed more. 

Well, I wish I could. But the opposite is true. I started to put prospects on a waitlist. We can't accept new clients right now. 

However, the goal of Enablement is not to be a lifestyle business for me and Gilbert to take home a lot of money and chill in Dubai. 

The goal of Enablement.ch is change. 

We fundamentally believe that the old predictable revenue model is broken. 

95% of SDRs are wasting their time with soulless grunt work.

And we're here to change that. To change how companies go to market.

- Cost efficient (so bootstrapping remains an option) 
- Meaningful (instead of building list in SalesNav)
- Effective (combining in&outbound -> Allbound)

For that, we need help. 

Specifically, we need an absolute A-Player who: 

-> speaks German
-> has no-code automation skills
-> has marketing/sales know-how 

and who wants to be among the Top 1% in the AI & GTM Space. 

Which is why we're hiring a GTME (Growth Marketer +RevOps Expert) to help our clients build the most insane GTM Allbound Engines with AI.

Yes, our employees can make more than most lead-gen agency owners. However, it's not all roses & sunshine

DOWNSIDES:

GTM is changing every week. New tools, new AI models. We have to be on top of all of it, and this requires us to adapt all the time

They had the classic ""predictable revenue"" setup:

’ 5 SDRs supporting 3 AEs
’ ZoomInfo for data
’ Apollo for sequences
’ HubSpot for CRM

All the ""right"" tools. All the wrong results.

Their SDRs had high ""activity"" but little to show for it: 

’ Manually researching prospects with no buyer intent signals
’ ""Personalized"" outreach (wasn't personal at all)
’ Playing the numbers game

They booked some meetings, but the leads were not qualified AT ALL. 

The fundamental problem wasn't effort. 

It's the GTM Setup 

They used a 2020 sales playbook in a 2025 world. 

We replaced 4 out of 5 SDRs with 1 GTM Engineer and built automated workflows that identify prospects based on dynamic signals: 

’ Teamfluence to track social engagement
’ Sales Navigator to spot job changes 
’ TheirStack to monitor job openings
’ Clay for champion tracking 

We implemented Clay to:
’ Qualify accounts and leads using AI 
’ Find the right decision-makers
’ Generate hyper-personalized messages that reference specific pain points

To reach out to the leads, we used
’ Smartlead for emails
’ Heyreach for LinkedIn
’ Make to connect the 2

We kept just ONE SDR who focused exclusively on call leads that responded on LinkedIn and email and booked qualified meetings for the AE

In the old setup, the costs were massive: 
’ $30,000 for tools alone
’ $300,000+ for the SDRs

I.e. a total of over $330,000. With the new setup, they save 61% and spend less than $10,000 on tools.

Most B2B companies still run the old GTM playbook. 

And so did one of our customers. 

It looks something like this: 

- Marketing creates whitepapers, webinars and blogposts
- Team of 5+ BDR creates their lists, emails + calls them
- 2-3 AEs to close the leads

Costs to produce 50 meetings p/m: 
’ $6k for 1 marketing
’ $25k for 5 BDRs
’ $24k for 2 AEs
’ $5k for tools

Total: $55,000 per month in CAC

To make around $60k ARR in new sales 

CLTV/CAC ratio was around 3 and getting lower. That's why Investors pushed for profitability. 

So we enabled them to implement an AI-powered Allbound Playbook that looks like this: 

- Marketing creates LinkedIn content for founder & sales team
- GTM engineer sets up automated Allbound engine
- AE gets warm leads to call and close.  

The team looks different now and so are the results

Costs to produce the same 50 meetings
’ $6k for 1 marketing
’ $5k for 1 GTM engineer
’ $24k for 2 AE
’ $1k in tools

Total: $36,000

Difference: $19,000 per month

In other words, they were OVERSPENDING $228,000 per year. 

The question is, what would you do with an extra $228,000 in your bank?

Would such a setup work for you as well? Comment =G

urn:li:activity:7305298517755908096,"Spoke to 16 sales leaders of Earlybird Venture Capital portfolio companies today about how to build AI agents that book 20+ meetings and 1.2m ARR with just 1 salesperson. And how this impacts SDR teams.

BACKGROUND

In 2025 everyone talks about AI agents and how they're reshaping outbound sales. But few are discussing what this means for the people behind these roles.

This was the exact topic during today's masterclass I held together with HubSpot for EBVC's portfolio companies.

It matters.
A lot.

After sharing our own internal use cases that we use to generate a full sales pipeline with only 3 to 4h of work a month, there was one obvious question in the room.

""Does that mean SDRs will disappear?"" someone asked.

Here's what I told them:
’ The traditional SDR role isn't vanishing  it's evolving into two distinct paths

Path 1: GTM Engineers (GTME)
’ Knows prompt engineering & no-code 
’ Automate listbuilding & messaging
’ Ensure emails don't end up in spam
’ Fill AE calendars with meetings 

Path 2: Phone-focused SDRs
’ 100+ dials a day (instead of 30-40)
’ Only calls leads the GTME engaged 
’ Breaks into larger accounts

This creates a completely new sales motion.

Think about it.

The GTMEs build and maintain the automation systems that generate initial interest.

Phone SDRs focus exclusively on what they do best: having meaningful conversations.

For context: B2B SaaS companies with $100K+ ACVs particularly need those relationship builders. 

It's how got one client with 8 SDRs down to a team of 2 while still bringing in $3.5m in new ARR. 

The human touch becomes MORE valuable, not less.

AI handles the repetitive tasks.
Humans provide the connection.
Both win.

What are your thoughts on the future of SDRs?

urn:li:activity:7305298517755908096,"Spoke to 16 sales leaders of Earlybird Venture Capital portfolio companies today about how to build AI agents that book 20+ meetings and 1.2m ARR with just 1 salesperson. And how this impacts SDR teams.

BACKGROUND

In 2025 everyone talks about AI agents and how they're reshaping outbound sales. But few are discussing what this means for the people behind these roles.

This was the exact topic during today's masterclass I held together with HubSpot for EBVC's portfolio companies.

It matters.
A lot.

After sharing our own internal use cases that we use to generate a full sales pipeline with only 3 to 4h of work a month, there was one obvious question in the room.

""Does that mean SDRs will disappear?"" someone asked.

Here's what I told them:
’ The traditional SDR role isn't vanishing  it's evolving into two distinct paths

Path 1: GTM Engineers (GTME)
’ Knows prompt engineering & no-code 
’ Automate listbuilding & messaging
’ Ensure emails don't end up in spam
’ Fill AE calendars with meetings 

Path 2: Phone-focused SDRs
’ 100+ dials a day (instead of 30-40)
’ Only calls leads the GTME engaged 
’ Breaks into larger accounts

This creates a completely new sales motion.

Think about it.

The GTMEs build and maintain the automation systems that generate initial interest.

Phone SDRs focus exclusively on what they do best: having meaningful conversations.

For context: B2B SaaS companies with $100K+ ACVs particularly need those relationship builders. 

It's how got one client with 8 SDRs down to a team of 2 while still bringing in $3.5m in new ARR. 

The human touch becomes MORE valuable, not less.

AI handles the repetitive tasks.
Humans provide the connection.
Both win.

What are your thoughts on the future of SDRs?

team. Here's how I am convinced that this is a stupid idea

Prospect: ""We just got $1.5m in funding""

Me: ""congrats, what you gonna do with it?""

Prospect: ""I want to hire 4,5 SDRs for sure""

Me: ""Mind if I ask why?""

Prospect: ""To build the pipeline of course""

Me: ""OK. Have you ever thought about doing it with AI & Automation?""

Prospect: ""Yes, but I still want to have a team""

I had to hold myself back. I almost told him: ""If you feel lonely, get a dog. Not a team of SDRs""

It's a mindset a lot of senior sales leaders still have. ""You need a big team.""

I get it. It sounds more impressive if you can tell someone: ""I manage 10 people""

Maybe you think you sound important.

To me, you sound outdated.

It's not a flex.

Bigger teams also mean more complexity to manage.

Complexity does not scale.

Let's look at it:

2 people ’ 1 line of communication
3 people ’ 3 lines
4 people ’ 6 lines
5 people ’ 10 lines
6 people ’ 15 lines
7 people ’ 21 lines

What's easier to manage and scale: 2 people or 7 people?

I'm more impressed when you tell me you have 7 AI agents working for you. 

Because this is what scales and agents can take care of ALL of your top-of-funnel activities.

Here are 4 agents we use to generate 7-figures with only 2 full time employees

urn:li:activity:7298668888685203457,"On Tuesday we launched a new campaign contacting 638 leads. Within 24h we booked 6 meetings with VPs & Directors - And I got accused of being an AI. Here's a full breakdown (and why it works) 

BACKGROUND: 

In 2022 two major things happened. B2B Startups got hit hard by it. 

1.) GPT Launched

’ ChatGPT launched
’ Launching a SaaS company got easier
’ Competitors can copy features within weeks

2.)  Fed raised interest rates to 5.5%

’ VC funding is down by 78% 
’ More companies competing for a smaller pie
’ Investors want to see profitability (shocker, right?) 

On the other hand, this created the perfect environment for companies to shift their GTM strategy radically. 

Instead of following the old ""predictable revenue"" playbook and hiring a bunch of BDRs/SDRs, it was time for a new approach. 

In 2024 the innovative companies made the shift. 

2025 the early adopters are following. 

Here's how we booked 6 meetings in 24h with them 

1.) 5ß5î55ò5ÿ-5ó5ü5ð555ò5ñ 55î5ÿ5ô5ò55ö5û5ô 

The ICP is very clear

- Selling a B2B Software
- 5 or more BDR/SDR

If you don't have 5 or more BDR / SDRs, you don't have the URGENCY to make the switch. 

I built that list in Clay within 15 minutes. 

2.) 5å5ö5ô5õ5 5ý5ò5ÿ55ü5û, 5ÿ5ö5ô5õ5 5ú5ò555î5ô5ò

A CRO thinks differently about the challenge than a Head of Sales. 

We created 3 different personas with different value propositions. 

AI matched the right message to the right person. 

3.) 5æ5õ5ü5 5ñ5ü5û'5 55ò5ù5ù

Everyone can write a message that looks like this: 

""We helped Acme and John Doe Corp to reduce their BDR team by 75% and still book 50 meetings a month"" 

Very few can write a message that PROVES that you can do it. 

Which is what we did. 

I wanted our leads to think: ""Damn, I want my BDRs to be able to do that?""

It's so good that people can't differentiate

 ""Did a human write it? Is it AI?"" 


RESULT: 
6 meetings in 24 hours, which means 180k in the pipeline. At our typical closing rate of 50% that's around 90k in revenue. 

TAKEAWAY
1. Have a very clear hypothesis
2. Test it against a highly targeted list
3. Reach out to the right person with the right message
4. Show don't tell.

They're running serious outreach numbers: 
’ 15,000 emails/day
’ 20% open rate
’ 0.1% reply rate

Despite these terrible numbers, they're making $150'000 MRR

Because the reply rate was so low, they thought: 
""We need to buy Clay and do hyper-personalised emails"". 

I facepalmed. 

They are solving the WRONG problem

If you have the fancies, personalized an relevant email
but it ends up in the spam folder. 

Does it matter? 

No. 

Nobody reads it. 

Here's how to spot if you have a deliverability problem:

’ Open rate below 55%
’ Reply rate under 1%
’ Bounce rate at 5%

and you've never done placement tests

If ANY of these match your stats, stop everything you do. 

Here's how to fix it: 

’ Never send from your primary domain - protect your reputation at all costs
’ Set up separate sending infrastructure with new domains & inboxes
’ Use a reliable warm-up tool to build trust gradually
’ Configure DNS settings (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
’ Mix Google, Microsoft & SMTP inboxes
’ Avoid buying from resellers
’ 25 emails per day
’ Use Smartlead

- Grew LinkedIn from (almost) 0 to 10k
- 50% renewal rate
- 100k MRR 

aaand had a baby. 

But it was not all roses

The 2 big mistakes

# 1 Incentives

Gilbert & I had a complicated model for calculating share-split when merging the companies. 

It was a great idea, but wrong incentives 

This slowed us down the first 6 months

# 2 - Shiny Objects

One of the hardest things as a founder is to say ""no""

I have 100 ideas every day

can't do all of them. 

In 2024 we said ""yes"" to too many things

- Spending too much time w/ the wrong leads 
- Projects not aligned with our mission
- Creating our own software

’ Say ""no"" more often

Everyone says it's the year of the AI Agents.

What does that even mean?

There are 4 levels to AI Agents.

Every level is more complex

But also 10x more effective.

# 1 - AI Copilot

Unless you've lived under a rock since 2022 you arrived at stage 1.

The AI copilot.

That means using ChatGPT, Claude or Perplexity

They are great for one-time tasks

’ Brainstorm some ideas
’ Analyse a sales call
’ Plan holidays

Great for ad-hoc task that you only need to do once. 

You still do the work, AI just helps you get it done faster. 

Unfortunately, this is where most people's AI knowledge ends. 

Never making it to level 2

# 2 - AI Modules

You're not using the chat interface anymore - you're connecting through the API in Clay or Make

AI is now part of your automation workflows and can

’ Write {icebreaker} email personalization
’ Classify email responses
’ Qualify leads

As long as you provide the input
the AI works automated
but still very linear

- No decision-making
- No autonomy

# 3 - AI Agents

Where the top 1% are right now. 

AI does not need any input anymore

Once set up agents can make their own decisions. 

You only need to provide the goal and the tools to get the job done

the agent will do the rest. 

We use agents for

’ LinkedIn content (research topics + create posts) 
’ Create Allbound campaigns (books us 20+ meetings) 
’ Create customer campaigns in 5min  

As a 2-man business, we make over $100k MRR
Without agents this would be impossible

# 4 - AI Agent swarms

Agents can be connected together into a team aka swarm. 

It will allow entire teams to be replaced. 

Agent 1: Does customer research and analyse sales calls
Agent 2: Creates & optimizes the strategy
Agent 3: Creates a list of target accounts
Agent 4: Researches each account
Agent 5: Writes banger copy. 
Agent 6: Coordinates it all.  

Currently, this is in the experimentation stage. 

OpenAI is working on it and documenting it on GitHub.

If 2025 is indeed the year of the Agent
2026 will be the year of the swarm

urn:li:activity:7272641327870160896,"A SaaS founder showed me the financial model he used to raise MILLIONS of $$$

(his financial model confused the hell out of me) 

When interest rates were 0% the playbook was simple

’ Raise millions
’ Hire a bunch of BDRs
’ Give everyone an Apollo.io seat
’ Spray & pray outreach to the entire TAM

And it worked

The financial model startups used to forecast their growth was crazy. The revenue growth was DIRECTLY linked to the number of sales reps they hire. 

Throw money at bodies 
and the bodies solve your pipeline problem

That was the logic. 

But by the end of 2022 two things fundamentally changed

1. Interest rates are not 0% any more
2. OpenAI launched ChatGPT and the API

Startups now cannot get crazy funding rounds any more. 

Funding is down to $54 Billions in 2024

From $178 Billiions at the peak

That's down 71%

So the GoToMarket motion HAS to change

and the AI boom made it POSSIBLE to change it. 

and yet startups still model their growth depending on how many sales reps they plan to hire. 

This model is fundamentally broken. 

There is a new model. 

It looks like this: 

’ 1 GTM engineer (they build all the automation)
’ 1 SDR for intent-based follows (hand-raisers only) 
’ 1-2 AEs to do discovery & closing

And marketing supports everyone with a custom LLM to create banger LinkedIn content 

instead of writing blogposts and yet another boring whitepaper

And it works: 

=I Skilfit went from 2 to 20 meetings p/m with 1 SDR
=I Emlen fired 4 BDRs and produces the same $$$
=I Trawa achieved their yearly targets in Q3
=I Orca is closing a $150,000 deal.

Most GTM Strategies are just copy-paste of what worked before. 

But to get better results you have to do things nobody is doing

Personalization is important

So you use AI to come up with {{icebreakers}}

2022 called, they want the play book back

You're 3 years to late

# Level 3

Clay had its breakthrough moment in 2024

Everyone talks about it

A couple use it

few master it

If you do, you're getting massive results. 

However, they're already diminishing 

We've used the SAME campaign in 2023 and 2024. 

The results are down over 50%

New strategies are required

# Level 4

You've stopped building lists manually

Everything is centred around triggers events. 

And you combine them with a problem that you can solve. 

This is the best strategy to reach a cold audience. 

You're in the top 1%

But as Steve Jobs said: ""There's one more thing""

That's the top 0.1%

# Level 5 - Allbound aka top 0.1%

These campaigns perform 4x better than any trigger-based campaign. 

It's the combination of trust, automation and laser-sharp targeting.

These are the questions we all have to ask ourselves before Xmas. And of course, what will be different in 2025? 

Some key areas we see happening right now across 75 B2B Tech companies

=I 1) Painkillers > Vitamins

In your next discovery call, ask the prospect

""What happens if you don't fix this problem?""

If the answer isn't something like ""we're in big trouble""

then you know you're either talking to the wrong person or you're solving the wrong problem

If nothing changes, when nothing changes, then nothing changes

=I 2) Centralise

I asked someone on LinkedIn the other day ""how are you using AI in your sales right now?""

The answer actually shocked me a bit

""We literally fired all BDRs and do it now with AI & Automation and the results are even better""

An entire BDR team fired and now all is managed by a GTM engineer and a couple of AEs. 

This is a trend. And will be a major theme for 2025. 

Centralise it
’ 1 marketer that creates content for the founder + executives
’ 1 GTM Engineer that runs outreach (Clay, Smartlead, Trigify etc.) 
’ 1 SDR that warm calls leads that raised their hand. 

=I 3) Content

LinkedIn is the big white space right now. 

A client told me last week: ""Lanny I posted something for the first time myself and I instantly got 2 inbound meeting requests"". 

But founders don't have the time to post 5x a week. 

’ Create a Claude project
’ Marketing creates the posts + visuals
’ Founder approves 

It's the process I use and it 2.5x our business this year.

Mighty Elon has spoken
LinkedIn is the worst human invention

Ever

I understand why some think that way. 

Too many ""What proposing to my girlfriend taught me about B2B Sales"" posts

or yet another ""I'm proud to announce that...""

Nobody wants to read this. 

And most B2B Founder stop right there. 

""I don't want to sound cringe"" 

So they don't post. 

Which is one of the biggest mistakes you can make as a founder or sales leader. 

LinkedIn gave me much more than I put it. 

In 2024 alone, LinkedIn helped me to: 

’ Create almost 1 million impressions
’ Which saved me $35'000 in ads
’ Book 20+ meetings per month
’ Generate $200'000 in sales

If I did not start taking it seriously in April this year

NONE of it would have happened. 

And all I could do would be asking myself ""what if""

So If you're thinking: 

’ ""Should I post this?""
’ ""Does this sound cringe?""
’ ""What will others think?""
’ ""This is not me""

Just do it.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7267220615747530752,,6 months ago,lanny-heiz,ACoAABrwydgBQ_qD2JKjaDpeGZaghHDvJpTIGh8,Lanny M.,Heiz (,Using AI to create a Full Sales Pipeline without big BDR teams( Clay Enterprise Partner | Founder @ Enablement.ch,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQGpZoz78NNXZQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1687284271466?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=kxmd5kRmU5wSKlq3AVphOcXUIkVXqu2Dg0iLfiNIYtA,,1.0,,,,True,No,No,No

I knew that LinkedIn was extremely powerful

And I did not just want to post ""something""

Here's how =G

I've collected over 150 amazing LinkedIn posts in a gsheet

I grouped the posts by style

’ How to post
’ listicles
’ X vs Y
’ Story

This tells me ""how"" to write. 

# 2 - Create a custom Claude
Uploaded the templates to a Claude project (like a custom GPT)

Why Claude?
It writes like a human 
not like an AI

# 3 - Added more info

The custom claude project would already create great results

But to take it to the next level, I've added more input: 

’ Main challenges of my ideal customer
’ Goals of my buyer persona
’ Personal info about me

This tells the AI about ""what"" to write

# 4 - Generate content in seconds

All I have to do is to give Claude the topic: 

""Create a listicle about the best way to use AI for LinkedIn content"" 

and it will give me 3 variations for it. 

I can either refine it
or post it straight away. 

# 5 - BONUS to add another $100'000

Impressions ` $$$

You also have to follow up. 

This is what we use our ALLBOUND approach for. 

It performs 4x better than any other campaign

and added another $100k revenue.

’ Open Jobs
’ Job Changes
’ Website Visitors
’ Engaged with me on LinkedIn

This way we're sure that we reach out to the right lead at the right time

2. AI for Hyperpersonalised message

We use clay to get more data about the company and the person

and then use AI create the perfect message (as if we would write it manually)

3. Personal Branding

It's the Nr. 1 cheat code for your outreach

1. Post relevant content
2. Scrape profile views, likes & comments
3. Reach out with a personalized message (see point 2)

No ""No-brainer offer""

Last week, Gilbert Kralinger and I sat down.

After Q2 we knew something needed to change. 

Sales was OK-ish
Clients were getting results. 

But we knew there was more. Something was putting sand in the engine, but we did not know what it was.

So I asked him: ""What do you enjoy the most?""

He said: ""Work on the product and helping clients. You?""

""Marketing & Sales"", was my immediate response. 

And then it clicked. 

We were not 100% focused on what each of us does best. We were doing both things. 

So we made a radical decision. 

""Lanny, you bring the clients. I make sure they are successful.""

Gino Wickman calls that ""right person, right chair""

Q3 was all about implementing that change

Since then, we

’ Created an Allbound Workflow that 4x our meetings
’ Launched our own Smartlead - HubSpot integration
’ Over 50% of our clients renew their contracts
’ Recreated our entire consulting platform
’ Helped clients to literally 10x results
’ Generated $220k profit

All as a 2-man show. 

But there is still work to do.

’ Speed up time to value to 4 weeks tops
’ Establish LinkedIn ads as a channel
’ Raise pricing by 10%

So I started an outbound motion

I manually checked websites and sent a personalized loom that shared ideas about the current marketing automation setup and how they could improve it. 

This process  worked like a charm

18% meeting rate 

But it didn't scale 

So I hired BDRs (failed) and external agencies (failed) until through trial and error we found a winning system in 2021. 

It all led me to where I am today.

The number one reason for empty pipelines

You're pushing ""nice-to-have"" solutions.

But customers need ""painkillers"".

Who wakes up in the morning and wants to transform HR into an empowering experience?! 

You need to ""talk their language""

Speak like they would complain in front of their co-workers.

Stop tracking your job applicants excels and keeping employee files in Google Drive folders.

>• Outdated playbook from 2020 

You hire a bunch of BDRs and think they will fix your pipeline problem.

Aka ""throwing bodies at the problem""

The BDRs get Apollo to build their lists manually and then reach out from there as well (or use the HubSpot Sequencer) 

Best case with some templated sequences or worst - completely AI written.

The outcome is sky-high operational costs, much stress with hiring and training and often still... an empty pipeline

Scrap the BDRs, SDRs and Inside Sales Reps and invest in solid tech.

This is way more efficient.

We generate 100k per month with a single person running sales and a completely automated Allbound system.

Here's how I added 5k followers in the last 6 months

1. Follow 20 influencers my ICP listens to
2. Activate notifications when they post
3. Leave a ""micro-post"" as comment

People see that and notice

""This Lanny guy is smart""

Check out my profile

I catch that signal and automatically qualify them in clay and reach out if they are a good fit.

The result?

urn:li:activity:7249070975567196161,"Google declared war on your B2B Outreach
(how to prepare for it) 

This month, Google is launching ""the most dramatic improvement in the 20 years history of Gmail"". 

Officially, it's to improve safety. 
But the impact on outreach is clear. 

Here's what they do to detect spam now: 

’ Google trained their LLM on ""abuse patterns""
’ It scans incoming emails before delivery
’ 1000x more spam is reviewed daily
’ AI decides what's suspicious

And this is not just for enterprise users. 
It's for every Google Workspace. 

What this means for your B2B Outreach: 

’ It gets even harder to land in the primary inbox
’ Your normal outreach could get blocked 
’ Right setup is even more important
’ Quality > Quantity


What do you need to change now?
Everything
Nothing. 

Depending on whether your current setup already follows best practices. 

’ Multiple domains
’ 2 inboxes per domain
’ 25 emails per inbox per day 
’ Using Google & Microsoft Inboxes
’ DKIM, DMARC and SPF records set up
’ 80% of every email is variable (personalized)
’ Send text-only emails (no links, tracking images etc.)

These are just the technical basics.

More important is that you: 

1. send the right message
2. to the right person  
3. at the right time. 

An Allbound Approach to your outreach makes sure of that. 

Instead of reaching out to an ice-cold audience, contact people who have seen your content on LinkedIn, been on your website and are already familiar with your brand.

With this approach, we 4x the number of meetings booked by our main campaign. 

The future of GTM is not cold outbound. 
It's Allbound.

- He did his homework and research
- connects a trigger to a problem
- Clear value proposition
- personalised & valuable

So what's the problem? 
it was done manually. 

All of it can be done using Clay in 15 minutes. 

So instead of spending 15 minutes to craft 1 email
You can spend the same time on the setup & create 1000s of emails

While still keeping the same level of personalization.

If you're emails are not getting any replies
you're using personalisation the wrong way. 

It's not about being personal
it's about being relevant. 

Here's how you do it: 

Step 1: Do your homework
’ Clearly understand the problems of your ICP first
’ Look for trigger events (e.g., new role, hirings etc.)

Then create a list of leads around these trigger events. 

Step 2: Enrich your data
’ Use Clay to gather more info about your prospect
’ Check their LinkedIn activity for recent posts
’ Use Claygent to get more details about the company. 

Step 3: Craft a relevant opening
’ Feed the data into openAI to craft relevant messages
’ Link the trigger event to one of their problems 

Step 4: Provide clear value
’ Show how your solution solves their unique problem
’ Use case studies or metrics relevant to their situation

Step 5: Make it easy to respond

Fast forward to today, he:
- books 5+ meetings per week
- runs campaigns fully on autopilot
- has more sales than his product can handle

This wasn't luck.

4 months ago. Lukas Grabenwoeger, co-founder of Skillfit, made the decision:

""we create a true outreach engine""

Lukas was inspired by tools like clay and creating hyper-personalised messages at scale.

They already used basic tools like Apollo and had a sales rep but did not want to hire a big team. 

- But it took them ages to build targeted lists
- The messaging was just spray & pray
- Therefore, their results were bad

You can't build a company on 2 meetings per month

So he signed up for our GTM Enablement Program and implemented this playbook:

1. Foundations

First, you need to understand who your target customers are, what the problem is and why they want to solve it.

Easiest way to get this is:

- Read competitor reviews online
- Listen to your sales calls
- Review competitor ads
- Interview customers

With this, Lukas was able to:

- Use trigger events to see if a company has a problem
- Write a relevant message using our SPIRE Framework
- Create an irresistible lead magnet

Next we helped him build the...

2. Sending Infrastructure

The best message does not matter if you get blocked by the SPAM filters.

So we helped him with the correct setup:

- Buy new secondary domains like ""getskillfit"" 
- Setup DKIM, DMARC and SPF records
- Warmup for 2 weeks with smartlead
- 60/40  between Gmail and MSFT
- 2 inboxes per domain

With that in place, it was time to build:

3. Data enrichment & AI copywriting

Lukas knew what messages he wanted to write

(if he had to do the research manually)

Now he just needed to build the clay table

- Enrich the company and put it into the right subsegment
- See why the company has a problem and need skillfit
- Use that info + OpenAI to write personalised copy
- Find the right decision maker + valid email
- Upload it automatically into smartlead

The first campaigns were live after only 5 weeks and the results spoke for themselves: 

In the 24h they booked more meetings than any campaign ever before

<Æ The Results:

Since then, Skillfit GmbH is in a prime position: 

- Book 5+ every week
- 1 Sales rep that handles everything
- Needed to pause campaigns to keep up with demand.

=Ý 2 Takeaways:

Skilfit and Lukas understood what modern GTM is all about.

1. It's about using AI to take care of the simple steps and being able to create relevant & personal messages.

2. You don't need a big team to do any of that.

A huge thank you to Lukas Grabenwöger & Wladislaw Gerfort for the collaboration

1ã - Gather Data

First you need to get data

’ Scrape the LinkedIn ads of your competitors
’ Scrape Review sites like G2 or Trustpilot
’ Record all your Sales calls
’ Put it all in Gsheets 

The ads will tell you how you competition talks about the problem
and what benefits they highlight. 

The review sites tell you what the main problems are 
and what is missing in the current solutions. 

The sales calls are the biggest gold mine of them all

2ã - Analyse Data

Upload the different Google sheets into a custom Claude Project
much better than GPT for this. 

Ask it the right questions

’ What are the use cases customers are trying to get done? 
’ What are the problems with the current options?
’ What would the perfect solution be? 
’ What is the impact of it? 


3ã - Use it

This will get you a detailed, 20 page document about your ICP & persona. 

Based on data
not gut feeling

Now use it to to train AI on your ICP
and create any type of content

urn:li:ugcPost:7241088324168294400,"How to identify customers who changed jobs and reach out automatically in 5min for less than $800

Steve Richard had this problem last week. He has a list of 14'000 customers and wants to know: 

- Who changed jobs?
- Where do they work now?
- Is the new company an ICP fit?
- What's the new email address? 

2 customers (one is a major CRM) had the same problem. 

So here's how they did it in 5 minutes 
for $500-800 or less. 

=I Step 1 - build the list of customers

Identify all the customers you want to monitor. 

If you can't do that within 10 seconds in your CRM
you have a massive data quality problem. 

Once you have the list, import it into Clay
using the SFDC or HubSpot integration
or upload a CSV file

=I Step 2 - Identify Job Changers

- Use OpenAI to find the LinkedIn profile
- Enrich the profile using OpenAI 
- Compare the current company with the one in your file. 

If the company does not match, you now know: 

’ They changed jobs
’ Who the new company is
’ What their title is

=I Step 3 - Identify Job Changers

Compare the current company
with the company in your CRM? 

L No Match? 
 They've switched jobs

You now know the new company
and their new title. 

=I Step 4 - Qualify for ICP fit

Enrich any data points you need to see if they fit your ICP. 

’ How big is the sales team? 
’ What technologies are they using? 
’ What are their Goals & Challenges right now? 
’ Or any other information you can see on their website. 

Then feed that data into OpenAI at let GPT score the accounts. 

Only the ones that fit move on

=I Step 5: Fin their new email

Waterfall through different data providers. 

If one does not have it, 
Clay automatically moves on to the next one. 

If you need more than 1k emails
sign up for Prospeo to save clay credits. 

=I Step 6: Add to Campaign 

’ Add the leads to your Smartlead campaign
’ Update your CRM with the new company. 

Setting this up in clay will take less than 5 minutes. 
and cost you about $500-$800 
for 14k contacts.

urn:li:activity:7237468313100963841,"Just turned 31. Here are the 31 lessons I wish I knew at 21 to build my company. (Nr. 10 is the most important one.)

1 - Sales is your moral duty. If the prospect has a problem and you can help, you HAVE to win them as a client. Otherwise, you are liable for malpractice.

2 - Money is the measuring stick for the amount of value you provide. The more you give, the more you get.

3 - Dont worry about what other people think of you. They dont care - and neither should you.

4 - Never sell hourly. It means you have never done it before and dont know how long it takes.

5 - The more opportunities, the more you can be picky. The better the results of your customer.

6 - Disqualify hard and early. If they dont have a problem or the money, nothing will change.

7 - Talk to more strangers. Every person you do business with was once an unknown person

8 - SOPs are not limitations. They make outcomes predictable & ensure quality 

9 - Trust your gut instinct about trends. If you feel something will be big - go all-in.

10 - The woman you marry is the most important business decision you'll ever make.

11 - Its not just about who you know. Its about who knows you. Build your brand.

12 - Document everything. Your process, your results, your wins, your failures.

13 - Only take advice from people whove successfully done what you want to do.

14 - Focus is the ultimate superpower. Design your environment to maximize it.

15 - If youre the smartest person in the room, youre in the wrong room.

16 - Never decide out of desperation. Always from a place of abundance.

17 - Focus on the business, not the girls. This way you can have both.

18 - The red flags were always there in hindsight. Take them seriously

19 - Only work with A-players. Have 0 tolerance for average output.

20 - All prices are made up. Charge for the value you provide.

21 - A process makes things repeatable and predictable.

22 - Be careful what you wish for - you might get it.

23 - Stack your skills. Its like compound interest.

24 - Write it down. It creates clarity and vision.

25 - Sell like a doctor. Diagnose & prescribe.

26 - Cheap Charlies are the worst customers.

27 - Sales = helping people make a change.

28 - Just do it - You'll land on your feet.

29 - Buy more Bitcoin and buy it earlier.

30 - It will work out. Don't doubt it.

31 - No pain, no change.

urn:li:activity:7234074397362327553,"Google killed open rates tracking. You have to stop it. Here's why =G

In the latest Gmail update, Google put the final nail in the coffin. 

3 reasons why open rates are now dead

=I 1 - Not accurate

Open tracking works by adding a small image (1x1 pixel) to your email. 

If this image is loaded
the email is ""opened""

Apple changed the game back in 2022

Every incoming email is loaded by a proxy server
and thus reported as ""opened""

’ Your open rates are reported higher than they truly are

=I 2 - Deliverability

Because open rate tracking adds an image 
it impacts the deliverability of your email
negatively

’ Email lands in ""promotions"" or ""spam""
’ lower email opens 
’ less email replies
’ no meetings

It does the opposite of what you're trying to achieve. 
The irony...

=I 3 - Latest update

If all that was not enough to convince you to turn it off. 
Google just killed it. 

Now your prospect sees a big  banner on top of the email

""This message might be suspicious or spam""

And a big button right next to it

""Report spam""

1 click. 

done. 

=¨ Takeway - Don't track open rates

’ Inaccurate
’ Hurts deliverability
’ Report spam in just one click

But nobody has data. 

We ran the test

And the results surprised me. 

Because it's not the setup we have.

We took the leads from our last campaign
so we know if the emails are valid
or if they bounced. 

Then we ran the contactes through the 3 best tools:

×’ BetterContact 
×’ FullEnrich
×’ Clay

To see who finds the most truly valid emails. 

And these are the results: 

>G Clay: 65.71% 
>H BetterContact: 61.25% 
>I Fullenrich: 56.38%

Clay found the most valid emails. 

Does that mean you should only use Clay? 
No. 

Why?

Here are the costs per valid email: 
(if you are using the middle tier plans)

×’ FullEnrich: 5.5 cents

So what should you do? 

1. Integrate Bettercontact into Clay
2. Run Bettercontact
3. If they can't find it, run Clay. 
4. Only use providers that Bettecontact does not have

- terrible email & phone number quality

Ocean.io
+ highly targeted lists
+ Create a look-a-alike list of your existing customers
- Only gives you accounts (upload them into Apollo to find people)

Trigify.io
+ very simple setup
+ best tool to create signal-based lists
- can give you only small lists if the signal is weak

Telescope
+ easy interface - just describe your ICP
- coverage is not huge

 #2 5Ù5ö5û5ñ 5ò5ú5î5ö5ù5 5î5û5ñ 5ý5õ5ü5û5ò 5û55ú5ï5ò5ÿ5

Prospeo
+ Easy to export leads from Sales Navigator

- No phone numbers

FullEnrich
+ Access to 15 data providers
+ Very good data coverage

BetterContact
+ Access to 20 data providers
+ Catch-all validation 

Clay
+ Much more data than just emails & phones

""How are we going to make $1m in 5 months?""

This was 4 years ago in my previous role. 

The pipeline was not empty. 
But nowhere near target. 

It did not come as a surprise
but it hit different.

The months before we did everything: 

""if we offer more services - we can also make more revenue"" was the thinking. 

But this is not the solution.

DUH. 

As Aesop said: ""In trying to please all, he had pleased none.""

So we focused: 

’ 1 Problem
’ 1 Solution
’ 1 Persona

then reached out to them. 
personalised
pre-AI

VA's from the Philippines was the trick. 
No-one was doing that back then
Results skyrocket. 

We ended up hitting the target. 

If I was behind my goal again 
here's what I would do now: 

# 1 - Email Infrastructure

Buy 10 domains 
Set up 20 inboxes (Google & Microsoft 50/50)

# 2. - List Building

Use Ocean(.)io to find companies that look like my customers

If you don't have a lot of customers 
use Apollo for an initial list

# 3. - Upload to clay 

Upload the list into clay
and find the decision-makers 
+ get their email & phone numbers. 

# 4. - Signal

Use AI and find  1 relevant signal as a reason to reach out. 

Some ideas: 
’ Observation you made on their website
’ Job Description in a job add
’ Technology they are using 
’ Relevant Industry news
’ LinkedIn post

# 5 - Pitch
Use AI to explain how your product helps to solve a problem that is specific to them. 

# 6 - send
Sync the leads over to smartlead and start sending

# 7 - Analyse & Improve

If you're in Europe you should get double-digit replies and 20-30% of those should be positive. 

If you're not there, experiment around. 
You should be able to book 10-20 meetings per month minimum from this. 

This takes care of the immediate pipeline. 

# 8 - Personal Branding

urn:li:activity:7214991434687332352,"If I started as a Sales Leader/CRO here are 6 steps I'd do in my first 30-45 days

1. Identify your best customers

Check my CRM to see the 10 most profitable customers we won last year

if you don't have that data in 30 seconds that's already a first issue.

2. Interview these customers

Schedule a 30min conversation with the 10 customers.

Use the Jobs-to-be-done framework and ask questions like

- What was the problem you tried to solve before you bought from us?
- Why did you buy from us and not from competitor X?
- What made you say ""Wow I need this!""?
- What made you not so sure about going with us?
- What was the main benefit you got from using our solution?
- How would you pitch us to a friend?
- What friend do you have in mind who could benefit from us? 

Record the call using fathom.video so you have the transcript for later.

3. Talk to your sales reps

- Schedule a meeting with 2 or 3 best sales reps.
- Find out what makes them successful
- What makes them lose deals?
- Ask them what are the main blockers
- Remove them.
- Record the meeting for the transcript.

4. Scrape G2, Trustpilot or other review sites

Scrape the reviews from your customers
and your competitors
(use Instant Data Scraper for this)

Focus only on the 5***** and the 1* reviews
they are the ones with the strong emotions. 

Put it all into a big spreadsheet

5. Use AI to create ICP

Feed the transcripts, spreadsheet & the CRM data into ChatGPT
(Claude Projects work the best)

Ask Claude then to create your Ideal Customer Profiles based on data.

Works best if you have a conversation with it. 

Even if you already have a documented ICP. This exercise makes sure it's based on the latest data and you REALLY understand it yourself.

6. Do a pipeline creation audit

Use the following checklist to see where you need to improve to make sure you're not losing out on sales pipeline.

- Do you need more than 30 seconds to get any data you want from your CRM?
- Is each sales rep creating their own list (using a tool like zoominfo or apollo)
- Is your meeting booking rate on cold outreach below <1%?
- Are you not reaching out to your website visitors automatically?
- Do your sales reps write emails manually?
- Are you paying any tools other than your CRM on a per seat basis?
- Are your reps only posting marketing stuff on linkedin / post nothing at all?

Anything you've answered with ""yes"" is an area for improvement.

If you've done these 6 steps, you have a great overview of the current situation.

Now it's time to create a plan of action.

Here are the 6 steps again:
1. Identify the best customers
2. Interview them using the JTBD framework
3. Talk to your best sales reps
4. Scrape review sites
5. Use AI to create your ideal customer profile
6. Do a pipeline creation audit.

(Never seen anyone do #4)


#1 Start with a Single Vendor

If you're a beginner and never done any outreach, 
use a single vendor like Prospeo, Findymail

You can directly export search results from Apollo or Sales Navigator.

#2 Use a Series of Data Providers

That's called a waterfall enrichment

If one provider doesn't have the email, 
move to the next. 

Best tools for this: FullEnrich or BetterContact. 

Each gives access to over 20+ providers 
so you don't have to buy every single tool

#3 Use Clay

Clay has built-in waterfall enrichment with over 10+ providers

And it can do so much more

So you never have to import or export a CSV again

Once it's in there, you can create your entire campaign in a single spreadsheet. 
(like using AI to create hyper-personalised messages) 

Downside: It costs more than just using Bettercontact or Fullenrich (around 2-10 cents per email)

#4 *Combine Fullenrich/Bettercontact with Clay

If clay is a fantastic tool but 
fullenrich and bettercontact are cheaper
why not combine them? 

Never seen anyone do this

Why? 
There is no native integration

Good news
We built this

Sometimes you can have your cake 
and eat it too. 
<p>$

Here's the 4 levels of email finding again =G

1/ Start with a Single Vendor 
2/ Use waterfall enrichment
3/ Leverage Clay
4/ Combine Fullenrich/Bettercontact with Clay

With bloodshot eyes I closed my laptop.  ""finally done!"" I thought. 

I just managed to integrate ChatGPT into a spreadsheet - and use it to create personalized first lines based on job descriptions. 

Back in the 2020/2021 we used VA's to do this - and now I could do this in seconds. 

This was the ""iPhone moment"" of AI for sales. 

""I just need to find a way to put a lot of data into a spreadsheet and feed that info to AI. Then I can create hyperpersonalised outreach""

With ducktape and superglue I managed to integrate some tools. But it was sooo tedious and did not REALLY work.

Then in December 2022 I listened to a podcast episode with >¾Eric Nowoslawski. My jaw dropped when he mentioned Clay

""They've built exactly what I want!""

I instantly tried to sign up but there was a waitlist. Eric helped me to get past it and I finally got the email from Kareem Amin with my access. 

It felt like I discovered fire - again. 
and one of the best-kept secrets. 

""Why is Clay not used by every single GTM Team?!""

Now -18 months later - it is. 

And we and our clients are using it in all kinds of ways: 

- Enrich CRM data
- Find Investors
- Attract talented people
- Created LinkedIn posts (like this one) 
- And of course, scaling the most creative outreach campaigns.

I have yet to meet a busy executive who loves voice memos

""I don't know you. I see that you voice message is 60 seconds long. 
Why should I listen to that?""

It buts the burden on me - not you

And from past experience
I also think this: 

""it's just going to be inaudible rambling and a pitch.""

Can't remember the last time I actually listen to one if it was cold outreach. 

You may say now: 
""But we get great results with that!""

Great, happy for you. 
However, I'm almost 99% certain that it's not because of the voice note.

You just have a fantastic message.
People care about that - not about your voice.

(I was shocked)

Usually, this is the holy grail:
- Buy 5 domains
- Setup 10 Email Inboxes
- Join a warm-up pool for 2 weeks

= Your emails never land in spam.

Every outbound agency is using it
And every guru recommends it.

But is this a LIE?

Are cold outreach platforms selling snake oil - instead of the holy grail?

George Wauchope wrote a detailed article and Erol Toker did some research into it.
(links in comments) 

I was shocked when I read it.

The argument is the following:

Google & Microsoft are the biggest AI players in the world.
Do you think they dont realize what youre doing? Really?

You believe that they don't see that:

- Your new domain is sending only emails to other fresh domains?
- All emails you send and receive come from the same outreach platform?

Gmass - one of the biggest email platforms - had to shut the feature down because google explicilty told them:

""To keep access to the Gmail API you need to disable the email warming feature""

Email warmup pools are like engagement pods for social media.

Instagram and LinkedIn immediately see that this is not organic engagement
and then, they shadow-ban your reach.
(
So is email wamup a scam?
I don't know. 

For us, it worked well in the past. 
But Erol saw a clear improvement when he STOPPED the warm-up. 

Reason enough for us to do our test now.

Just bought new domains
Will A/B test now

One group will warm-up
The other not.

Then we use the accounts for our next campaign.
Should we report on the results?

(and why it was worth every cent) 

Will Brown had a successful Exit with his consulting company and sold it for multi 7 Figures.  
Last weekend he had a workshop about his journey. 

""You can only learn from the people who've successfully done it,"" I said to myself. 

When I got home my wife asked me: ""How did you like it? 
""yeah was good""

""don't sound very convinced.  Was it worth the thousands of dollar's you've just spent?"" she asked

The answer was very simple. 

Did I learn something fundamentally new? No, actually not. 
I knew a lot of these things. But I did not focus on them enough. 

Tiger Wood knows how to play golf
Roger Federer how to play tennis

And yet they always had someone giving them advise
A fresh pair of eyes from the outside. 

So here's what I needed to hear: 

¡ 1. Quick Decision-Making

The best entrepreneurs are able to make decisions quickly. 
Even with limited information.

’ Entrepreneurship is decision-making
’ Sales is helping people make decisions
’ Not deciding is a decision itself

¡ 2. Right Seat, Right Person

When analyzing my daily activities, I realized I was not always the best fit for every task.

What if delegating could actually boost our performance?

What if I'm hindering growth by not allocating tasks appropriately?""

The aha-moment:

- Right seat
- Right person

Gilbert Kralinger is a brilliant operator. He get's sh*t done. 
- He holds client's accountable 
- Keeps them on track
- Explains complex ideas in simple ways (client's love him in our weekly calls) 

I'm not the best at these things. My qualities are different. 
- Strategy & Vision
- Sales 
- Leading the way
- Working on the product

So we decided to shift our focus. 
No more ""everyone is doing everything."" 

Right seat, right person. 

¡ 3. Cost of Inaction

Ever thought about what inaction costs your business?

Yes, Agencies, Software and Consulting costs money. 

But have you ever thought about 

- What does it cost you, if you don't automate your lead generation? 
- Learn to use AI RIGHT NOW (not in 6-12 months)

Done is better than perfect
Take action

¡ 4. Avoiding mistakes is more important than doing it perfectly

I was not unsure if the business was on the right track. 

- We invest in creating our own software because 75% of clients have that problem
- Are we positioned correctly? 
- We already have the best product in the market - should we still invest in it? 

The answer was always: YES

No more doubts in my mind. 
Full focus on execution. 

¡ 5. Knowledge is ROI positive

You cannot get any dumber. 

You can lose everything in life
And yet you keep your experiences. 

If I only win one client more because of the insights from the last couple of days

It was already ROI positive. 

You cannot lose if you invest in yourself.

1 week ago Matthew Roberts went viral. 

He posted an email of Jared Dietz. Its fantastic. 

- well researched
- connects a trigger event to a problem
- Clear value proposition
- personalised & valuable

So what's the problem? 
it was done manually. 

All of it can be done using Clay in 15 minutes. 

So instead of spending 15 minutes to craft 1 email
You can spend the same time on the setup & create 1000s of emails

While still keeping the same level of personalization.

Our first campaigns did not work. 
Low responses
No meetings. 

But we did not know why. Did we 

- Reach out to the wrong person? 
- Address irrelevant problems? 
- Offer a lame solution? 

We did not know. So we needed to test this. 
But we lacked a clear framework to test properly

That's when we came up with the S.P.I.R.E framework.

Hi {{first.name}}
Just read the job description of the BDR role you're hiring for. (=ö Signal)

You specifically mention ""cold calling CFs & VPs of finance"". So I guess booking meeting via the phone is key for your sales. The issue for many teams is, that connect rates are low (=) Pain) 

I've called finance leaders before and it's was time sucker. I spend hours dialing just to get 1 or 2 conversations. (=0 Impact)

Acme removes all the small steps of calling. We helped seismic & slack 5x their convos. Without enduring hours of voicemails & ringtones. (=Š Remedy)

- Craft different variations of your messaging. 
- Only change one variable (1 letter of SPIRE). 

For example, you write your email but only change the Remedy part. 
You present your solution in two different ways. 

Then you send each variation to ca. 500-1000 leads

Now you know which remedy is more compelling. 

We use this framework for every campaign together with our clients. 
Now, campaign variations are created in a matter of minutes. 
With a clear structure and test.

1ã 5Ý5ü5ï 5Ö5õ5î5û5ô5ò5
Obvious one. Most people forget one thing however

- Go on Sales Navigator
- Filter for people who changed jobs
- Scrape them (Prospeo, PhantomBuster or Evaboot )

This is where sales reps usually stop. 

The best ones also export the boss of the person who recently started. 
""Hey, saw that John recently started as your new sales lead""

2ã 5Ø5ú5ý5ù5ü55ò5ò 5ÿ5ò55ö5ò55 
Glassdoor, Kununu and Indeed all have employee reviews. 

Goldmine to understand what employees love 
and what they hate

Use Claygent to find the reviews and look for specific topics that relate to your value proposition.

3ã 5á5ò5ô5î55ö55ò 5Ö5555ü5ú5ò5ÿ 5å5ò55ö5ò55
People love to complain. And you can use that to understand where a company is doing well
and where they need to improve. 

Use Clay to find the reviews and OpenAI to tell you exactly what the problems are. 
And how your company is the best at solving them.

Job ads tell you exactly where a company wants to be in the next 6 months. 

Better than any ""intent data"" by 6sense or bamboora.
and it's free. 

- Scrape job ads from LinkedIn or indeed with Apify
- Use AI to search for specific topics

(learn from my failures)

- Manually researching every prospect (does not scale)
- Hiring a junior and try to teach him what you found is working (i failed)
- Outsource to an agency that sprayed and prayed (that was terrible)
- Hire the best BDR from the competition (huge culture clash)


Here's my 10 commandments. Nr. 8 is crucial. 

1. Actually provide value. Nothing trumps that. If your message sucks, people will report spam. 

2. Master the technical basics. But don't overcomplicate it. 

3. Learn from people who are doing it successfully. Everyone has an opinion. Results don't lie. 

4. You never know if a campaign will perform well - until you hit send. 

5. Perfect targeting with mediocre messaging ALWAYS trumps mediocre targeting with perfect messaging

6. You have to get better every day. What works today, will not work as well in 6 months. 

7.  AI & Automation find more data than you can manually. You only need to train it right. 

8. Prove that you understood the problem and can solve it. Case studies don't count. Only a free preview does. 

9. Build a personal brand. People will know the name when you reach out. It also gives you a good reason to reach out if they engaged. 

10. Don't juggle with 13 different CSV files. It creates a mess. 

Bonus: Track everything in your CRM. You want to understand what the ROI of your activities are. Invest in a solid integration.

How I used to work in 2022:

- Get a VA to scrape lists for me
- Implement GPT3 as a custom script in Google Sheets
- VA to create custom scripts, so I can integrate with different tools
- A LOT of troubleshooting
- Manually upload the CSV into lemlist

It was a pain. And a lot of manual work.
Joggling different versions of CSVs
Messing up the data.

Until I found a tool that had everything
Even the things I did not even know I needed.

That tool is Clay.

- Create lists
- Enrich data to find your golden ICP
- Create relevant & personal copy with AI
- Send leads directly into your campaigns.
- Never use CSV uploads again.

Magic >„(

That was 13 months ago.

Since then, we
- Spent ca. 1.6m+ credits on clay
- Built more than 100 tables
- Onboarded 15 customers

Today, Enablement.ch and Clay are officially partners.

Big thanks to Varun Anand & Team for an amazing product, Arturo Orozco for the best support, and >¾Eric Nowoslawski for all your content.

To celebrate the partnership, I'm sharing a clay table that booked a client 20+ meetings last month.

Real Client Example: 

John, you have offices in 3 locations outside the UK with 100+ FTEs. 

Thus, you are probably converting around £3.5m for payroll from GBP to EUR and PLN per month- 

These pairs have an average volatility of 21.5%. Thus, you could lose up to £9.03m per year.  

Typically, B2B SaaS companies hedge that risk with a broker. But then they have to send 5 emails and make 7 phone calls. and if they want to make changes, it's even worse. 

You could do that with just a few clicks. Open to seeing how?

Because CVs on demand isnt enough

The game has changed.
Top recruiters now look like operators.

If you want to stay billable,
You need to be insight-first, not intake-first.


Heres what that looks like in practice:

1. Build your workflow around speed, not volume
- Spray-and-pray doesnt convert anymore
- design leaner outreach flows
- fewer steps, tighter messaging, faster follow-up


2. Speed up your job campaign sequences
- dont wait 5+ days between touches
- condense your steps. Be politely persistent
- use signal-based follow-ups, not just time-based ones


3. Track employees leaving key companies
- departures = pain points.
- pain points = urgency to hire.
- earlier and proactive signal than a job ad


4. Monitor growth signals in the market
Funding rounds, product launches, new partnerships ...
all mean change, often with headcount attached.


5. Prioritise leads with real intent signals
- sort contacts by recent activity, not just job title
- look for role changes, content engagement, or hiring posts
- Intent beats guesswork every time.

Clients dont care how many people you contact.

They care how quickly and accurately
you find the right one.

This is what being niche and proactive looks like.

Its the difference between being seen&
and being paid.

Together with Niklas, we joined Sean Anderson for his Hoxo event to deep dive into what recruiters are really struggling with - and how to solve it.

Why?
Because being good isn't enough, we're here to be the best in our niche - and serve our recruitment clients at a whole new level.

So we don't only aim to be the most technical agency in this niche but also have the best domain knowledge in recruitment.

Some key takeaways from Sean's keynote:
- Recruiters need a personal brand. Not tomorrow - today.
- Recruiters should specialize and become a leader in their niche.
- AI isn't replacing you. Its your ally for research, data, and admin tasks
- Want better response rates? Build a community. Be a thought leader. Send warm, high-value messages.

Shoutout to Sean and the Hoxo team for putting together an event that challenges us to level up. Was nice to chat about the current status of Recruitment and AI.

Right now it probably looks like this:

Problem?
Theyre already hiring.

Top recruiters dont wait.
They show up first - with candidates.

One client just filled 3 roles
before the hiring manager sent a spec.

Heres how they did it:

Our workflow monitors every signed client.
It scrapes their career page for new roles.

It qualifies relevance using AI.
Then matches roles with warm CRM talent.

If no fit is found internally,
It auto-sources candidates from LinkedIn + Apollo.

AI compares every profile to the brief.
Best matches are added to the CRM and assigned.

Recruiters get notified,
So they can strike first - before anyone else does.

No briefs. No delays.
Just faster, smarter delivery.

This is how you retain top clients.

You stay plugged into their hiring activity.
You reactivate existing talent on autopilot.
You lead the conversation, not chase it.

But actually I did a lot of networking and met many new people this week - which got me thinking. 

(of course also for dinner, coffee, ...)

Ever wonder why some environments seem to boost your success while others seem to hold you back?

I've been comparing the contrast between networking in Germany vs Dubai.

Here in Dubai, connecting with people feels easy.

In every chat I have, there's an openness to meeting that I rarely experienced before.


The most surprising part? 

It doesn't matter if someone is ""above"" you in business or life achievements - there's a genuine willingness to connect, share insights, and explore opportunities together. 

Every conversation has led to either new friendships, business partnerships or intros.

This environment has completely transformed my mindset. 

Seeing others succeed around me doesn't trigger insecurity - it proves that success is attainable with the right hustle and determination.


Take this as your sign to evaluate your environment. 

Are you surrounded by people who align with your ambitions? 
Do the places you frequent inspire growth or complacency?


As the saying goes: ""Show me your friends and I'll tell you who you are.""

Your environment shapes your reality more than you might realize. 

Choose wisely.


Whats the biggest shift you noticed when changing your environment?

urn:li:activity:7322956590335094784,"Last week I rejected a workflow request from one of our clients. Here is why..


Some AI workflows might sound cool but right now they are just a shiny object for your staffing agency. 

Many leaders go and rush to implement the latest AI tools without considering if they actually solve their specific challenges at their current growth stage.

The answer isn't working harder, hiring more people, or chasing trendy AI feature - it's about implementing the RIGHT AI systems at each specific stage of growth.

Here's what most founders miss: 

The exact systems that fueled your agency's early success will eventually become the bottlenecks preventing your next breakthrough.

That's precisely why we've shifted to comprehensive strategy calls instead of typical discovery sessions when onboarding new clients.

For example: 

When we started working with a foundation-stage agency hungry for business development, we built trigger-based outreach workflows that delivered interested replies directly to their team - giving them qualified leads without endless prospecting.

As their client base expanded, their challenges evolved. 

With business development set, they needed delivery-focused solutions. 

We pivoted to create AI workflows that automatically build candidate shortlists based on job briefs from their CRM, complete with talent scores and ready-to-go outreach sequences.

This adaptive approach is why recruiting agencies increasingly choose customized AI strategies over generic software solutions or those ""AI features"" bolted onto their CRM/ATS that rarely deliver meaningful results.

The systems that power your early-stage agency must evolve as you grow.

The right solution isn't universal - it transforms alongside you.

What stage is your recruiting agency at, and are your AI workflows aligned with where you need to grow next?

Let me tell you what I love the most about it - aside from the tax/business setup situation...

The convenience factor here is truly next level. 

I can order almost everything to my home in 15 minutes - groceries, meals, household items. 

Need a haircut? A barber comes right to my doorstep. 

This lifestyle allows you to spend your time exactly where you want it.

Working intensely for 16 hours and can't leave your desk? No problem.

Home cleaning services, food delivery, and grocery ordering are all just a few taps away on your phone.

That said, it comes with its own challenges. 

It's easy to get too comfortable with this convenience, and when the weather is perfect with a pool right outside your balcony, staying focused at your desk becomes a real test of discipline!

But the opportunities here - both business and networking - are simply unmatched. 

The community of professionals and entrepreneurs creates an environment where connections happen naturally and meaningful collaborations form quickly.

I truly enjoyed my first three months here and am starting to feel more and more at home.

Always happy to connect and smoke a shisha or grab a coffee - so let me know if you're visiting Dubai!

Anyone already got a trip planned?


PS: this is me grabbing some noodles from the grocery store next to our apartment - because even the 15 minute delivery cant beat that and I was very hungry =

They're leveraging AI and automation to deliver deeper, strategic value to their existing clients.

Today, being a recruitment partner goes beyond simply filling roles. Its about becoming a trusted advisor, providing meaningful insights that empower clients to stay ahead.

Here are 3 impactful ways recruitment firms are using AI & automation to add serious value:

1ã Real-Time Market Insights
- Automatically track hiring trends, competitor activities, and emerging roles
- Provide your clients with actionable intelligence quickly, enabling informed decision-making without hours of manual research

2ã Predictive Candidate Analytics
- Use AI-driven analytics to predict candidate tenure and retention rates
- Anticipate future hiring needs, helping clients proactively manage talent and avoid costly turnover.

3ã Personalized Client Communication
- Automate personalized messages with insights tailored specifically to each client.
- Ensure every interaction strengthens your relationships and demonstrates ongoing value.


Youre no longer ""just another recruiter"" - you're a strategic partner integral to your client's success.

How are you trying to deliver additional value to your clients and do you think AI can help you with this?

""My best recruiter just quit. Said she couldn't handle another 9-hour day searching LinkedIn and our CRM for candidates that might fit,"" 

Their remaining team was drowning:
3+ hours just to process notes from each client call
8+ hours searching across platforms for each role

Manually checking each profile against requirements
Copy-pasting data between systems

The worst part? After all that work, clients were still saying: ""These candidates don't match what we discussed.""

Now, their system:
- Pulls key requirements directly from client call recordings
- Searches LinkedIn and their CRM simultaneously
- Uses AI to match candidates against specific criteria
- Creates ready-to-send candidate summaries

This Wednesday, I spent 45 minutes showing Tim Krasenbrinks community of agency owners how to use AI & automation to scale their B2B services.

I walked through practical applications with Clay, demonstrated our automation systems, and answered questions about implementation. 

The feedback was incredible - Agency owners reaching out, asking questions, and looking to implement what they'd learned right away.


This is exactly why I'm so passionate about strategic partnerships.

Whether it's sharing knowledge with communities or on LinkedIn or collaborations with for example Dualta Doherty businesses to showcase AI automation value in recruitment - these relationships create win-win scenarios that pure marketing simply can't match.

So please consider this...

In today's crowded B2B space, what sets you apart isn't just your product or service - it's your ability to build meaningful connections and provide value upfront.

For the next few months, we're doubling down on this approach:

- Developing strategic partnerships with complementary businesses

- Creating helpful, practical content that solves real problems (Launched our free recruitment resource hub this week as well)

- Building relationships based on trust and shared success

The AI landscape is evolving rapidly, and I'm convinced the businesses that thrive won't be the ones with the biggest marketing budgets - they'll be the ones with the strongest partnership networks.

What has been your most impactful relationship?

Start using this M.O.N.E.Y. framework:


We work with dozens of recruitment teams - from boutique agencies to 50+ headcount firms - and the difference between average and high-performing ones often comes down to how well they leverage automation.

Heres how AI can be your silent partner in closing more deals:

M  Monitor hiring signals
AI can track job boards, career pages, and LinkedIn updates 24/7. Youll be the first to know when a company starts hiring or opens a new role -before its public knowledge.

O  Optimize outreach
Personalized outreach at scale isnt just a dream. With the right tools, AI writes tailored messages that reflect job titles, pain points, and company context - boosting your reply rates.

N  Nurture talent pools
Most recruiters lose warm candidates due to lack of follow-up. Automations can handle regular check-ins, updates, and even interview prep - keeping your pipeline warm and ready.

E  Evaluate candidate-job fit
Manually comparing CVs to job specs is slow. AI tools can instantly score resumes, highlight top matches, and flag red flags - so you spend time only where it counts.

Y  Yield performance insights
From tracking campaign performance to identifying bottlenecks in your hiring funnel, AI gives you visibility into what works - so you can double down on results.

And thats where the real compounding value kicks in.

Because once you have the data, you can test, tweak, and scale every part of your process.

Youll stop guessing and start building repeatable systems that deliver consistent placements.

Thats how 5-person teams start performing like 15-person agencies.


Whats the one area in your recruitment workflow where you wish you had more time to do more impactful tasks (or chill at the pool)? =@",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7318245564427472896,,1 month ago,ai4sales,ACoAACjI6X8Bi5a12c9R4mysd1wrKMpvKx6wo7c,Fabian,Herhold,3x your placements with AI & Automation | We help recruitment businesses scale without hiring more people | Co-Founder @ Automindz,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQF1ASXTPLhf3w/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/B56ZRBV0I5HoAg-/0/1736263025787?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=a8zzDJ3OZdO5oAZcuk6Jncd1fV0CmyN5XLhU4R-537s,3.0,,1.0,,1.0,True,No,No,No

A place built on belief, tradition, and timeless beauty.

While standing there, I had a strange thought&

In the past, belief shaped everything.
It moved people, built cities, created cultures.

But today?
Some things dont wait for belief.
They just happen.
AI is one of them.

Right now, its changing how the world works - including recruitment.

Many agencies still dont believe in it.
They think AI is just a trend or not for us.

But while they wait, others are moving fast:

 Automating time-wasting tasks
 Growing without hiring more recruiters

 Build lists of hiring managers from job ads
 Scrape LinkedIn profiles that match live JD criteria
 Personalize outreach based on tech stack, location, seniority


2. lemlist

Multi-channel outreach on autopilot (email + LinkedIn + voice notes).

=¡ Use cases:
 Send hyper-personalized messages with dynamic job & candidate data
 Use voice notes to stand out in candidate outreach
 Reactivate cold leads with sequenced follow-ups


3. Recruit CRM

Your recruitment HQ. ATS + CRM, integrated with your workflows.

=¡ Use cases:
 Manage candidate pipelines, notes, and tasks in one place
 Trigger automations when CVs are uploaded or interviews scheduled
 Sync enriched data from tools like Clay or BetterContact


4. Instantly.ai

Email outreach tool built for scale without burning your domain.

=¡ Use cases:
 Run high-volume outreach with inbox rotation
 Send cold outreach to hiring managers from job board scrapes
 Set up sequences based on job signals or site visits


5. n8n

Your automation logic engine. Think Zapier, but turbocharged.

=¡ Use cases:
 Automatically create tasks in your CRM after a call transcript
 Trigger data updates across your tools when a placement happens
 Build custom workflows across LinkedIn, email, CRM, and spreadsheets


6. Prospeo.io or BetterContact

Find verified emails and phone numbers in bulk. Fast.

=¡ Use cases:
 Enrich missing contact info for outreach lists
 Keep CRM data fresh and usable for campaigns
 Match candidate profiles with contact info for submission

You dont need 100 tools.

You just need the right 58 that:
 Talk to each other
 Reduce manual work
 Drive actual placements

I recently received this cold message (yep, it was so long I had to take TWO screenshots to fit it)


Heres where it completely fell apart:

- No personalization
- No trigger - no reason why now or why me.
- Immediate CTA to book a call - without offering any value.
- Reads like a pitch deck, not a conversation.
- Way too long - even for an email and this is LinkedIn

Worst part? Im not even their ICP.

Outreach isnt about mass-blasting and praying for replies.
Its about timing, targeting, and earning attention.

 Build smarter lists.
 Personalize with intention.
 Keep it short. Spark curiosity.
 Give value before asking for time.

If youre a recruitment agency and dont have the tech skills to get this setup&

You know who to message.

Lets raise the bar on outreach.

Here is what was going on this week in my life as a 26-year-old agency founder in Dubai:

This week wasnt all wins and sunshine.

Personally, I had a few setback moments where I struggled and motivation was low. Being away from family, building something from scratch in a new country - its not always easy.

On the business side, one of our clients asked to pause. Not because of the results - those were great - but because he needed time to manage internal change.

And honestly, that made total sense.

When youre introducing AI and automation to a team, especially a larger one, its not just about tech.

Its about people.

They need time to understand it, adapt, and feel supported - not overwhelmed.

It reminded me that scaling with AI isnt just plug-and-play. Its a transformation. And transformation needs patience, communication, and empathy.

So while some things slowed down, Im grateful for the small wins:
 positive messages from happy clients
 Kickoff for a new client
 Still showing up every day, even when its tough

Momentum isnt always loud. Sometimes its just not quitting.

PS: recorded some content for a guest module in a friends course and also something for our youtube - so no podcast (yet), even tho it looks like it

urn:li:activity:7311012873751715841,"You just placed an amazing candidate for a client and wish you had 20 more clients just like this?

Let me show you how it's done!

The excitement of closing a great placement often fades into the challenge of starting from scratch to find your next ideal client. 

But what if you didnt have to start over each time?


Heres how modern recruitment teams can break this cycle and turn each successful placement into dozens of new opportunities - on autopilot:


1ã The moment someone in your CRM is marked as ""Candidate Placed"", an automation kicks in

2ã It identifies lookalike companies using tools like PandaMatch =< or Ocean.io based on the clients domain

3ã AI steps in next, automatically scoring these companies and enriching critical signals:

- Are they currently hiring?
- Did they recently secure funding?
- Have they recently hired a new leadership role or had a key employee leave, creating urgent skill gaps?

4ã Using Clay you instantly source validated contact information (work email & phone number) for decision makers at these companies

5ã For high-potential leads you automatically create a task in your CRM for manual outreach & medium potentials are directly funneld into automated LinkedIn outreach via lemlist or email via Instantly.ai


Et voilà - youve effortlessly built a powerful pipeline of ideal prospects on autopilot!


(Pro tip: Enhance your outreach by referencing the recent placement that triggered this workflow, e.g., We recently placed a Director of Sales at a similar software startup like yours in California.)


Don't you think automating your outreach and recruitment like this would help you scale your business?

Thats what a recruiter told me last week.

And honestly& its not the first time Ive heard it.

They werent bad agencies.
They had fancy dashboards, clever copy, aggressive outreach.

But they missed the one thing that matters most in recruitment: timing.

See, recruitment isnt like SaaS.
Youre not selling subscriptions.
Youre selling the right person at the right time - to the right company.

By the time a cold email lands, the role might already be filled.
The hiring manager might be in a different time zone.
Or worse& the agency looks like every other one in the inbox.

Thats why more leads arent always the answer.
And why flashy tech alone wont get you meetings that turn into revenue.

What actually works?

’ Tracking real hiring intent
’ Speaking the language of recruiters, not bots
’ Replacing manual follow-ups with tools that actually save you hours
’ Building systems that support your team - not just your sales targets

At Automindz Solutions, we dont try to be everything to everyone.
We just focus on recruitment.
And on building systems that make your pipeline move without adding headcount.

If youre tired of chasing leads that go nowhere, maybe its time to build smarter.

Because you, as a recruiter connect and spend a lot of time on LinkedIn... you're sitting on a goldmine of connections - many of whom fit your ideal customer profile perfectly.

Here's a simple, (almost) free workflow to tap into this resource:

1ã Export your LinkedIn connections (it's completely free!)
- under your profile click on ""Settings & Privacy""
- go onto ""Data Privacy"" and then ""Get a copy of your data""
- Request your data archive

2ã Upload this list to my Clay template
- Copy the template into your workspace (you can start with a free trial account)
- upload the csv-file of your connections
- adjust your ICP definition in the prompt
- let Clay score and rank your connections based on how well they match your ideal customer profile


This simple process helps you identify which connections to prioritize without spending loads of money on leadgen tools.

I've been using this method to find warm leads hiding in plain sight. 

Instead of cold outreach to strangers, I'm reconnecting with people who already know me.


Let me know in the comments if you are interested in this Clay template and I'll send it over!

Business side of things:

- worked on more internal SOPs and optimizing delivery/client experience

- cleaned up and optimized our ClickUp which we use for project/task management (anyone know some good content creators on YT that might have relevant tips for agencies?)

- had some sales calls where we were able to validate the need for the stuff we are building and publishing soon on top/after our DFY offer

- started to build out some crazy lead magnets we will publish soon and also implement on our website (which could also do a revamp, since we did our pivot)

- from next Tuesday on I will start a new series ""Fabians Flows"" where I explaining every Tuesday a useful sales tech/automation flow in more detail that you can use


Personal stuff:

- my sister visited for a few days, as she was coming back from an Australia trip  

- still not able to cook in our new apartment, as the gas sensor needs to be replaced (so a lot of alternatives and ordering food for now)

- watched some of the craziest sunsets I've seen so far in Creek Harbour

urn:li:activity:7307736295026446338,"""We went with another agency.""

Those words probably cost you $30k commission last month. =¸

The harsh truth? 
In 2025, recruitment isn't about WHO can find the best talent... it's about WHO CAN FIND THEM FIRST.

But here's the problem:
- When you rush, quality suffers
- When you focus on quality, you lose candidates to faster competitors
- When you try to do both manually... burnout city =%


Most agencies are stuck in this loop because they're doing EVERYTHING by hand:
- Sourcing jobs (manually)
- Building candidate lists (manually)
- Matching them one by one (yep, manually)

Meanwhile, your best recruiters are drowning in admin instead of doing what they're actually good at - building relationships!


This is where automation creates a game-changing flywheel effect:
= Qualify a great candidate ’ System instantly matches them to open roles
= Sign a new client ’ System finds relevant candidates immediately 
= Build candidate lists ’ System reaches out with personalized messages

The result?

By the time traditional recruiters are still formatting CVs, you're already scheduling the first interviews.

Your team finally has time to:
- Build genuine relationships with candidates
- Check-in with clients to get new jobs
- Provide actual career consulting

You probably think tech will replace recruiters.

You should know better: tech doesn't replace recruiters - it transforms average recruiters into exceptional ones.

Here is what was going on this week in my life as a 26-year-old agency founder in Dubai:

""How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time."" 

This week and the past few weeks, we were doing a lot more mid-term and long-term planning for the company

A) Where do we see ourselves and our company in 3-5 years?
B) How do we get to 1M$/month?


Because the journey to 1 million a month is a long way and while you should think of the overall play and long-term goal, its also important to make smaller goals and milestones along the way to not get lost...


Thinks we thought about:
- What are the first smaller steps we can take
- How can we keep the team lean
- Are there any partnerships/people that can help us along the way


But I think we now have a really clear goal and roadmap that will get refined along the way, as we all know things change and it never comes as expected


One key decision: We're prioritizing building repeatable and working systems with clear SOPs first, which will allow us to grow faster while keeping our team lean.


But one thing is for sure...

Keep an eye out - we will make moves in the recruitment space with AI & automation!

Imagine this:
You're consistently reaching and influencing the exact people you want to work with. 
Your content visibility triples, engagement rates grow, and you finally get the inbound signals you've been waiting for.

Sound too good to be true? 

Here's our secret: the ""Connection Request Waterfall.""

Exactly how we execute it:

<¯ Step 1: I start by sending a personalized connection request to a decision-maker within one of our ideal customer profiles (ICP) - our dream client list.

<¯ Step 2: After 7-10 days, Niklas, another trusted team member, sends his connection request to the same person.

<¯ Step 3: Another 7-10 days later, Frederik adds a third touchpoint by sending his connection request.


Why does this strategy perform exceptionally well?
=I The Familiarity Principle
People trust and engage more with content from connections they recognize and repeatedly see. 

=I Algorithm Advantage
LinkedIn naturally prioritizes posts from your 1st-degree connections, making your content more visible and impactful. 

=I Social Proof & Credibility
Multiple touchpoints from different team members increase credibility and trust.


We then patiently wait for clear engagement signals - likes, comments, shares, or inbound inquiries - before reaching out directly. This ensures each conversation is timely, relevant, and welcomed.

What has been your best approach to get into your dream lead accounts?

Here is what was going on this week in my life as a 26-year-old agency founder in Dubai:

This week I've been thinking a lot about how much I love my network. 

It's so cool to see how people at the top don't actually compete that hard with each other - we work together instead!

We have these awesome groups where we share tips and help each other out. It feels like we're all growing together. 

When we get leads that aren't a good fit for Automindz, we're always happy to share them with our friend agencies. 

And they do the same for us! 
We get referrals from them all the time.

I think the ""ocean of leads"" is just so big that the smart agencies realize this. 

Why try to do everything yourself when you can grow together? 
There are more than enough clients for everyone, so it makes sense to team up.

Community > Competition

This mindset shift has been huge for me. In the beginning, I was worried about other agencies taking our clients. Now I see how much better it is when we all help each other succeed.

So shoutout to all of you guys!!
You know who you are, and too many to tag here


PS: I've fallen in love with our area even more after the first week here. We finally got the most important furniture delivered - and just look at this private lagoon in our community, I mean ... =

’ Set up triggers so you reach out at the right time, to the right person
’ Follow up without spamming - personalized sequences that actually work

CRM & Sales Process Optimization
’ No more manual data entry - sync everything automatically
’ Track leads, job openings, and conversations without the admin headache
’ Report on whats working so you can refine and scale faster

Candidate Acquisition & Engagement
’ Set up always-on sourcing so youre never scrambling for talent
’ Automate screening, follow-ups, and interview scheduling
’ Keep your talent pool warm so you can fill roles before competitors

AI & automation arent here to replace recruiters - theyre here to give you leverage.

Theyre using smarter systems that free up their team to focus on what actually moves the needle.

If youre still relying on manual BD, outreach, and admin - youre leaving money on the table.

Ever notice how there's always that ONE recruitment firm in your market that seems to have it all? The clients, the candidates, the engagement...

Yeah, our clients were sick of watching it happen too.

Most recruiters struggle with LinkedIn. They post consistently, engage genuinely, try to build their audience  but it often feels like they're in an echo chamber, talking to the same 50 people over and over again.

Meanwhile, the big players? They're swimming in engagement, winning the best clients, and building massive pipelines without breaking a sweat.

But we discovered something game-changing for our recruitment partners: you don't have to start from scratch. You can actually leverage THEIR engagement to build YOUR pipeline.


Here's how we help recruitment firms do it:


1ã Capture the right audience

When industry leaders post content, who's engaging with them?
- Hiring managers actively looking for talent
- Candidates searching for their next role
- Fellow recruiters (competitors or potential team members)
- A handful of supportive connections

Using tools like Trigify.io, we track these interactions and build lists of real, engaged people who are already interested in recruitment content.


2ã Find the diamonds in the rough

Not every ""like"" is created equal! That's where Clay comes in.
We use Clay to:
- Enrich data with crucial details (job titles, company size, hiring plans)
- Filter out the noise so our clients are only focusing on actual decision-makers
- Prioritize people who are actively hiring or scaling teams
- Instead of spray-and-pray outreach, our recruitment partners are zeroing in on prospects who are already raising their hands.


3ã Reach out authentically

With a qualified list, we automate connection requests and messages  but in a way that still feels personal and thoughtful.
The results for our clients have been incredible:
- More meaningful client conversations without cold-messaging strangers
- Networks full of engaged hiring managers and quality candidates
- Less busywork, more high-value connections, and steady pipeline growth


While everyone else is chasing engagement, our clients are capturing it.

Want to stop the LinkedIn guessing game and start turning social activity into actual business? Let's chat!


P.S. Already the big fish in your pond? Our approach works on your own engagement too  just with way less manual grunt work.

Here is what was going on this week in my life as a 26-year-old agency founder in Dubai:

This week has been a complete reality check on what it actually means to transition from ""just founders"" to real leaders. As Niklas, Frederik, and I have meanwhile 2 new team members at Automindz, we've had some serious learning moments about remote leadership.

For the past year, it's been just us three co-founders grinding away, wearing all the hats, and somehow making it work. But now with our team expanding, everything feels different.

We spent hours this week in deep discussions about how to systemize our operations and optimize our delivery process. 

Task management for a fully remote team? Way harder than I expected. 

The systems that worked for just us three don't scale when you add more people to the mix.

What hit me hardest was realizing that being a founder and being a leader require completely different skillsets. 

When it was just us, decisions happened organically, tasks flowed naturally between us, and we all just ""got it."" 

Now I'm responsible for clearly communicating expectations, creating structures that others can follow, and making sure everyone feels supported while delivering quality work.

The mental shift from ""doing the work"" to ""leading others doing the work"" is honestly a bigger challenge than I would've expected. Finding that balance of staying involved without micromanaging is an art I'm still figuring out.


Any tips from some of the more experienced leaders, especially with remote teams?


PS: one of the benefits of moving to Dubai are some cool backgrounds in Cafes or views when doing video calls =@

urn:li:activity:7300488556664246272,"""We're too small for AI & automation"" - why this myth is holding back recruitment agencies:

We had a call this week with the founder of a 6-person recruitment team specializing in engineering roles for early-stage startups

When discussing automation solutions, he shared a concern we hear constantly:
""We've never tried anything like this before... we're probably too small to benefit from this level of automation.""

Sound familiar?

Here's what most growing recruitment agencies miss: 
Size isn't what determines if you need automation - it's your growth ceiling.

This team was handling up to 10 clients simultaneously but could only dedicate 1-1.5 days per client per week. Their 15,000-candidate database was sitting underutilized because manual searching was too time-consuming.


The real questions aren't about your team size:
- How many more placements could you make if sourcing was automated?
- What if your recruiters could focus exclusively on candidate engagement and client relationships?
- What's holding your team back from taking on more clients?

For this team, automation isn't a luxury for ""when they get bigger"" - it's precisely what will help them get bigger.

One of our smaller agency clients (just 4 recruiters) increased their placement capacity by 35% within three months of implementing our solution.

The most successful boutique agencies we work with don't use automation to replace their personal touch - they use it to amplify it.

Is your agency ""too small"" for automation, or is manual work keeping you small?

urn:li:activity:7300126160233848832,"Recruiters, your team should be posting on LinkedIn. 
Heres why (and how to do it without wasting time)

Lets be real. Most recruitment teams suck at content.

They either:
- Dont post at all because they dont have time.
- Share a boring company update once in a blue moon.
- Rely on one social media guy to do it all (who no one listens to).

And then they wonder why inbound leads are dry and outreach gets ignored.

Heres the reality: People buy from people.
And if your teams faces never show up, your agency stays invisible.

Recruitment is a game of trust. And trust is built before you even send a message.

Think about it:
- If a hiring manager sees your consultants name pop up on their feed 3-4 times before an email lands in their inbox, they are more likely to reply
- If candidates recognize your team as specialists in their field, theyll come to you first - before even thinking about applying elsewhere.
- If your recruiters are positioned as industry experts, you get inbound leads (instead of chasing).

BUT& lets address the pushback:
My recruiters dont have time to write LinkedIn posts.

Fair. But heres the fix:

AI-powered content systems for recruitment teams

Imagine this:
- your team drops a quick 30-second voice note sharing a hiring trend, success story, or market insight.
- an AI assistant turns that into a fully written LinkedIn post - formatted, engaging, and ready to publish.
- a system nudges them to approve & post - in under 2 minutes.

Zero writers block. No wasted time. Just consistent, high-quality content.

Result? Your agency stays top of mind - without draining your recruiters time.
Bonus? More inbound leads & easier conversations because people already know your name.


Its 2025. You can either stay invisible or own your niche online.

urn:li:ugcPost:7299765880891031552,"Recruitment is a research game.

If you dont know who youre reaching out to, what they need, and why theyre hiring - youre just guessing.

But heres the problem:
Most recruiters spend hours manually searching for jobs, researching companies, and finding decision-makers - when they could be closing deals and building relationships instead.

Thats why every recruiter should look into Clay to automate these steps.

=G Heres how it works:

1ã Find fresh job opportunities on autopilot
- Clay scrapes LinkedIn Jobs on a schedule
- Set your filters onceget a daily list of relevant roles
Never miss out on a hiring opportunity again

2ã Qualify roles & companies instantly
- AI scans job descriptions for exactly what youre looking for
- No more wasting time on irrelevant job posts
- Focus only on companies that fit your niche

3ã Identify the right decision-makers
- AI suggests who you should reach out to
- Find hiring managers & department heads - not just HR
- Enrich their details (email, LinkedIn, phone) automatically

4ã Ensure your contacts are worth reaching out to
- AI analyzes their profile, job history, and hiring signals
- Filters out bad leads so you dont waste time on dead ends
- Youre left with highly targeted outreach lists

5ã Personalize at scale
- AI extracts key info from job descriptions
- Highlights required skills, hiring urgency, company culture
- Generates custom outreach messages that feel 1:1


End result?
 You focus on building relationships
 Your outreach is highly relevant
 You save 10+ hours every week

Recruiters who use data-driven automation are the ones winning in 2025.

Here is what was going on this week in my life as a 26-year-old agency founder in Dubai:

- on Monday our 2nd employee started and is off to a good start, working on some more internal automations, while also watching us over the shoulder and learning about client projects


- we also hired somebody to help us out on graphics for content & ads, as we are not the best at it and also lack more and more the time and focus because of our growth


- got some global payment problems with some clients where we need to figure out a better and more flexible solution. was looking at solutions like Currenxie, but encountered some problems when registering 


- I've started posting always at 4:15pm GST | 1:15pm CET | 7:15am EST to make it easier for anyone interested to set their alarm clocks for when to watch out for my newest post.
 I've actually seen increased impressions over the last few weeks where I did this, but I also tried to start commenting more again - which is more likely the factor here.


- I got my Emirates ID and I'm now officially a habibi and was able to open up my bank account here 


- moving into our apartment next week and have already bought some furniture for it this Wednesday (couch, bed, ...), which all look super cool - need to give an apartment tour maybe once we are fully moved in?


Keep crushing it everyone - and a happy Friday!

Weve gone up against a lot of lead-gen agencies.
Some big names. Some fancy tech stacks.

And time after time, we win.

Not because we send more emails.
Not because we have some secret automation.

But because we actually understand recruitment.


Heres the thing&

Most agencies run the same playbook for every industry.

They treat recruitment like SaaS.
Or real estate.
Or e-commerce.

But recruitment isnt like any of those.

L Your leads arent shopping for a tool - they need a hiring solution.
L Timing is everything - if youre too late, the job is filled.
L Its relationship-driven - if you sound generic, they ignore you.

Recruitment leaders can smell a copy-paste sequence from a mile away.


Thats why we win.

 We track real hiring intent - open jobs, funding rounds, team expansions.
 We speak the language of recruiters and decision makers.
 We dont just book calls - we help sign clients who actually need talent.

But heres what makes us different:

We dont stop at outreach.

 We optimize your CRM and sales process so youre not chasing leads manually.
 We automate internal workflows (candidate tracking, follow-ups, pipeline reporting).
 We build custom recruitment automations that free up your teams time - for example building you a CV anonymization app.

Most agencies are just playing the numbers game.
We play the placement game.

And thats why our clients win.

If youre tired of wasting time on low-quality leads, messy admin, and outdated processes&
Maybe its time to work with a team that gets recruitment.

I'll be honest - stepping more and more into this leadership role is both exciting and humbling. Can't wait to be the kind of mentor I had early in my career, while also staying open to learning from my team. Because let's face it, the best leaders are also the best learners! 


The challenge? Building genuine connections in a remote-first world. Many think virtual means distant.

But here are 3 ways we're making remote work actually fun:

- virtual ""walk-ups"" - Just like real office drive-bys, but without the awkward coffee breath
- digital water cooler moments - Because the best ideas happen in random convos
- team hangout spaces - Where we collaborate, chat, or just vibe together


To all my fellow founders and team leads: You don't need a fancy office to build an amazing team culture. It's about creating spaces (even virtual ones) where people can learn from each other, grow together, and actually enjoy working together.


Looking forward to further growing the team and taking over the recruitment space with AI & automations =ª

Here is what was going on this week in my mind as a 26-year-old agency founder in Dubai:

This week, something on LinkedIn caught my attention. 

Someone was complaining that their email campaign wasnt working, and they blamed the tool they were using.

But then in the comments, the email that was sent out was revealed. And honestly? It was horrendous.

Not a single best practice followed. Not a single one of the many cold outbound.

The funny part? The person complaining had Email Specialist and Deliverability Expert in their LinkedIn headline.

And thats when it hit me again:
- LinkedIn is full of smoke and mirrors.
- People flex fake results without proof.
- Experts fail at the basics of their own craft.

Its a reality check. We see posts about people making millions, running hyper-successful agencies, or having cracked the code - but how much of it is real?

If theres no proof, no transparency, no actual value being shared& chances are, its just a front. A well-curated illusion.

Thats why Im so intentional about how I build Automindz and my personal brand.

- I don't want to be the next online coach or course bro ""making millions""
- I dont oversell AI automation - our clients SEE it working
- We show working systems in demos, not just on fancy LinkedIn carousels

Because trust is built through real value, real expertise, and real results.

So next time you scroll through LinkedIn, ask yourself:
- Is this person showing real proof, or just talking?
- Are they actually successful, or just good at looking successful?
- Do they deliver results, or just sell the dream?

At the end of the day, the best marketing is doing great work - because great work markets itself.

A recruitment client of ours just got 66 positive replies from candidates in less than a week personal emails. (Yep, the ones that are even harder to crack!)

=I The secret? Speaking the same language as their prospects.

Most outreach fails because it sounds off to the person reading it.

You wouldnt walk into a room full of engineers and start pitching like a sales rep.
You wouldnt talk to a tech founder the same way youd talk to a blue-collar hiring manager.

Yet, in recruitment, I see this mistake all the time:

L Talking like a recruiter instead of a peer.
L Forcing generic business jargon onto an audience that doesnt use it.
L Ignoring the words your prospects actually say when they describe their problems.

The fix? Match their world, their words, and their way of thinking.

=¡ Example: Speaking to a Software Engineer

Bad: We help companies hire the best talent and scale their teams.
Good: We help dev teams find engineers who actually write clean, scalable code-without flooding your inbox with resumes.

=¡ Example: Speaking to a Sales Leader

Bad: We streamline hiring processes to boost team efficiency.
Good: We help sales leaders stop wasting time on weak hires so they can focus on closing deals.

=¡ Example: Speaking to a Blue-Collar Hiring Manager

Bad: We optimize your workforce strategy with top talent acquisition solutions.
Good: We help you find workers who actually show up on time and stick around.

See the difference? One feels distant. The other sounds like something theyd actually say.

=I Speak their language, and theyll actually listen.
=I Sound like an outsider, and youre ignored.

Thats why this cold email campaign crushed it - because every message felt natural to the person reading it.

And when emails feel natural, people reply.

urn:li:activity:7295415092693651456,"Recruitment Email Subject lines that get replies

Lets be honest.

Your emails are competing with 200+ others in a hiring managers inbox.
If your subject line doesnt grab attention instantly, your message is getting buried.

Subject lines are a big part of email success. If they dont spark curiosity, your email wont even be opened.

So, how do you craft subject lines that actually get responses?

Shorter is better. Best practice is 1-3 words max - but some longer ones work too, depending on your audience. 
Always A/B test.

Here are 5 types of subject lines that work in recruitment - plus real examples you can steal:


1ã personal touch (use their name or company)

Why? People are wired to respond to their own name or something directly relevant to them.

- [First Name]  saw this
- [Company] hiring?
- (longer) Struggling to hire [Job Role] at [Company]?

Best for: Client outreach & re-engaging old contacts


2ã the open job trigger (hyper relevant)

Why? Hiring managers need talent. If theyre hiring, theyll open your email.

- hiring [job role]?
- 3 candidates for [job role]
- (longer) Saw your job post - heres an easy fix

Best for: Business development outreach to hiring companies


3ã curiosity hook

Why? If it sounds too good to ignore, theyll want to open it.

- miss this?
- worth a look
- (longer) The [Job Role] candidate you wish you found first

Best for: Engaging hiring managers who are skeptical about recruiters


4ã the problem solver""

Why? Hiring is stressful. Offer relief, and theyll listen.

- need help hiring?
- hiring is hard
- (longer) Tired of bad hires? heres a shortcut

Best for: Cold outreach to decision-makers who are actively hiring


5ã the urgency play

Why? People hate missing out - FOMO is real.

- last chance
- final call
- (longer) Only 24 hours left - exclusive access to top talent

Best for: Candidate placement emails & closing deals quickly


W Quick Reminder:
Assuming you have a decent infrastructure in place (please dont send from your CRM and dont use your primary domain). Try some of these out and see which one works best for your use case.

Gonna do a separate post on infrastructure soon.


Which one is your favorite to use?

If youre still relying on single-channel outreach, youre leaving deals on the table. 

Instead of waiting for responses that never come, diversify:
 Use automated email sequences for volume
 Prioritize LinkedIn for high-value prospects
 Call when engagement signals are strong

The most effective sequences combine LinkedIn, email & calls - not just one.


Pro tip: If a LinkedIn connection request gets ignored, pivot to email or pick up your phone. 

Some people just dont check their DMs.

Check the image, on how such workflow could look like using Instantly.ai & lemlist

urn:li:activity:7294690327255285762,"Are AI agents just hype? Well, yes and no. Let me share our real-world experience.

Since implementing n8n, we've built something practical and powerful - what you see here is our AI agents control module - beta version (credit to Niklas for the amazing work). 

While many throw around ""AI agents"" as a buzzword, we're focused on results.

This isn't sci-fi - it's a practical integration that connects to our everyday tools: LinkedIn, Google Calendar, Slack, Stripe, our CRM and many more.

And it will help us and our team's capabilities, not replace them.


For recruitment specifically, we're exploring specialized AI agents like:

1ã Skill matching agent: Analyzes job requirements against candidate profiles to identify strong fits

2ã CRM agent: Automatically updates candidate records, summarizes interview notes, and surfaces relevant candidate history when needed

3ã Interview prep agent: Prepares customized interview questions based on candidate background and role requirements

All these agents can be either interacted via 
- chat interface
- triggered via certain events
- on a regular basis

And there are much more ideas and use cases to this, than just these 3.

The future isn't about AI taking over - it's about humans and specialized AI agents working together effectively. 

No hype, just practical tools making our work more efficient.


Whats your take on AI agents?

Here is what was going on this week as a 26-year-old agency founder in Dubai:

One of my personal goals I had on my list was getting back into good shape.
Since we landed last week's Thursday I was already 6x in the gym of our tower. It feels really good and the convenience of just going down the elevator a few floors compared to leaving the house, driving 15 mins and then searching a parking spot in Germany is a big difference.

We looked at a few areas and apartments and have 100% identified Creek Harbour/Creek Beach as the area we fell in love with and wanna move there long term - already got a long-term rental pretty much safe for end of the month there.

Over the past few months we were scaling the agency a lot and to keep delivering the best quality for our clients we decided to hire a GTM automation specialist for our team to keep up with the workload and be able to onboard the new clients that are in the pipeline.

With scaling the team we also try to get our internal ops, onboarding and a lot of the stuff behind the curtains more optimized, templatized and professional - as we are not anymore a ""startup"" of 3 friends but soon will be a team of 5 or maybe 6 people, so we wanna start to do everything also more ""professional"" and optimized for larger scale.

Had quite some annoying cases/tasks this week regarding taxes, regulations etc. - but running a business is not always sunshine and that's alright.

Thats it for today's episode - Happy Friday everyone! >

Its not about sending more messages.
Its not about working longer hours.
And its definitely not about copying the same outreach templates everyone else is using.

The truth is:
Most recruiters dont have a lack of effort problem.
They have a lack of differentiation problem.

We recently helped a client land 40+ resumes of their dream candidates - without increasing their workload.

How?
We did things differently.

 We crafted unique, personalized outreach (not just Hi [First Name])
 We positioned an irresistible offer that candidates couldnt ignore
 We provided real value upfront, not just pitch and pray messages
 We added creativity - landing pages, voice notes, dynamic workflows,...

The result?
Higher response rates.
More engaged candidates.
And yes, those dream resumes delivered straight to their inbox.

If your inbox is quiet, your strategy is the problem.
Be bold. Be different. Be valuable.

Thats how you win in recruitment today.

urn:li:activity:7292516008613797890,"Your solution is great, but& its just too expensive.

If youve ever been in sales, youve heard this before.

In a recent call, a prospect told us:

Your proposal is the most expensive on the table, but its also probably the best solution. I just need to figure out the cost.

This is where most people panic, offer a discount, or start defending the price.

But heres the thing: Price isnt the real objection.

The real question is: Is the value worth the investment?

So instead of focusing on the cost, we reframed the conversation:

- Other agencies offer lead gen as a service. You pay them every month, and when you stop paying, the results stop too.
-
- We build a system inside your business. Its an asset you own. Even if we part ways, the system keeps delivering.

But heres what really made the difference:

We speak the same language as recruitment consultants because weve been in their shoes.
We dont just build systems-we bring recruitment expertise into the process.
Our clients dont just get automation; they get workflows designed by people who understand their world.

So yes, the upfront cost may be higher.

But over time? Its like comparing renting an apartment vs. owning a property.
One drains your money month after month.
The other builds equity.

Result?
The prospect saw the bigger picture.
We shifted from Is this too expensive? to How can we make this work?

Because when the value is clear, the price becomes a detail.

How do you handle pricing objections without discounting?

3. custom scraper for a niche job board monitoring and then reaching out with personalization based on the job description and automatically mentioning the best lookalike case study available

4. automatic transcript and import of notes/tasks with formatting it directly into the CRM after every qualification call

5. taking the job description and automatically building a people search on linkedIn that fit the job description (based on job title, experience, ...)

6. AI agent that can access everything in the CRM and you can ask anything like (""how many candidates do we have that want a company car as a benefit"")

7. content engine that you just can feed a voice note, and it will automatically do research on the topic and come up with drafts of different social media post formats

8. cloning a voice to then use it to include sending automated and fully personalized voice notes (not just ""personalizing"" first name - but the full transcript)

9. monitoring news websites by using a custom RSS feed then classifying if relevant and pushing into an outreach sequence

10. using just the profile pictures of people in a Slack channel to do a reverse Google image search to find their LinkedIn profile

on a personal level:

- packed my 3 suitcases I'm gonna take with me with the summer clothes and gave the winter clothes to store in my parents' basement

- I officially deregistered my residence here in Germany

- started the visa/immigration process for Dubai
 
- started to sell some household goods (luckily the new tenant bought the majority)



business-wise:

- improved our internal social listening campaigns with some new copy

- planned out some strategies to improve traffic on our Youtube channel and also diversify in the future (probably start with X/Twitter and focus on our newsletter again as well)

- had a review meeting with one of our clients we finished a project with to get feedback and further improve our internal operations

- finished the first version of a workflow for one of our biggest clients that is now being tested by 10 recruiting consultants internally

A lot of recruitment agency founders hit a revenue ceiling - and they think the solution is working harder.

More outreach.
More calls.
More follow-ups.

But at some point, more effort doesnt equal more growth.


The result? Burnout.

Youre stuck in the business, constantly juggling clients, candidates, and operations. And ironically, the more you try to grow, the more overwhelming it gets.


Heres what sustainable growth actually looks like in different phases of a company:

1. Foundation ($10k$250k): Build a client & candidate acquisition engine so youre not chasing leads manually.
2. Growth ($250k$1M): Automate delivery with follow-up systems & pipeline automation to free up your time.
3. Expansion ($1M$3M): Scale beyond yourself by implementing marketing, hiring & operations systems.
4. Maturity ($3M+): Optimize client & candidate experience to retain top talent & clients.

Scaling isnt always about hustling harder - its about systemizing smarter.

Building a business is one thing.
Building a business while uprooting your life? A whole new challenge.

Some days, it feels like everything is coming together perfectly. On other days, its pure chaos. But thats exactly why I want to document this journey.
- Whats working?
- Whats breaking?
- What lessons am I learning the hard way?

Ill share it all - raw, real, and unfiltered.

 Scaling a business in the recruitment space
 Navigating big life transitions
 The ups and downs of entrepreneurship


Then stick around. Fabians Founder Friday starts now.

If your team is spending hours scrolling through job boards, manually checking career pages, or endlessly searching LinkedIn for fresh job listings&

Youre already too late.

L By the time you find the job, another recruiter has already reached out.
L The hiring manager is flooded with applications.
L Your candidate? Probably placed elsewhere.

And the worst part?

Your recruiters already have a million other tasks.
¡ Sourcing and qualifying candidates
¡ Managing client relationships
¡ Handling admin work

With so much going on, business development takes a backseat.

If your team is too busy to proactively find jobs, your pipeline dries up.

The smarter way? Automate your job posting research.

With AI and automation, you can:
 Scrape job portals like Indeed, Stepstone, and Glassdoor for real-time job postings.
 Track jobs on LinkedIn that most recruiters miss.
 Monitor company career pages to get ahead of competitors with hidden jobs.
 Push everything into your CRM automatically.

This isnt just saving time - its saving money. 

Every hour your recruiters spend manually searching is an hour not spent placing candidates and closing deals.


More placements. Less manual work. More revenue. =€


And the best part?
This system runs on autopilot-no matter what other tasks come up.

Imagine having a 24/7 job discovery engine working in the background while your team focuses on closing more deals.

Here is the difference we can make:

Reverse Engineer talent moves


1ã Start with New Hires: Find people whove recently started a new role in your niche.

2ã Analyze Their Trail: Look at their previous employer. Whos covering their responsibilities now? Is there a skill or leadership gap that needs filling?

3ã Reach Out Strategically: Offer your services to backfill the position.



Its proactive, personalized, and solves a problem many businesses havent even realized they have yet.

1ã M essage: Start with a strong hook or insight that grabs attention.
2ã O pportunity: Highlight why this matters and the potential impact for your audience.
3ã N ext Step: Share one actionable takeaway they can apply immediately.
4ã E motion: Connect on a deeper level by speaking directly to their challenges and goals.
5ã Y ou: End with a clear call-to-action that centers on their needs and next steps.

 Build credibility with meaningful insights.
 Deliver value that keeps your audience coming back.
 Turn attention into real opportunities.

urn:li:ugcPost:7275802710438809600,"Lets face it  one common hesitation around tools like Clay is the price tag.

But heres what many miss:


Clay isnt just a tool. 

Its a central marketplace with 100+ integrations that allows you to test, experiment, and refine your approach to find what works for you.

And when used right, its not just a cost - its an investment that saves you time, boosts efficiency, and optimizes your results.

Still, if youre worried about burning through those credits, here are actionable ways to maximize value while saving Clay credits :

1ã Use the Claygent

Before spending credits, use the Claygent feature to extract website data. Its fast, efficient, and often the cheapest way to get foundational info like emails, LinkedIn profiles, or phone numbers.


2ã Leverage formulas

Clay formulas are a hidden gem. They let you clean, structure, and extract data before you even start outreach -perfect for saving credits while making your outputs more refined and effective.


3ã Bring in your own tools

Why use credits for email waterfalls when you can pair Clay with your existing email API subscription? It cuts down on credit spend while letting you save those precious resources for what matters most. 
(Same goes for your own OpenAI key)



Clay isnt expensive when you think of it as a tool that consolidates, simplifies, and enhances your recruitment workflows. 

Its the ultimate try before you buy platform for outreach providers.


Still think its pricey? 

Or are you ready to squeeze value out of it?

Its not luck, reputation, or even their networks. Its their systems.

Heres what they do differentlyand why it works:


1ã they nail timing and relevance

High performers dont rely on generic outreach or mass emails. 
Instead, they use triggers like:

- funding rounds
- job postings
- leadership changes

These signals tell them exactly when to reach out, making their timing (and messaging) spot on.


2ã they automate the busywork

Top agencies free their recruiters from manual tasks so they can focus on what matters most: building relationships. 

Automation handles:

- CRM updates
- candidate follow-ups
- lead qualification

This creates time for conversations, strategy, and closing deals - not admin.


3ã they rely on data, not guesswork

The best agencies dont hope things are workingthey know. 

They track:

- response rates
- time-to-fill
- candidate and client satisfaction

Then, they use those insights to refine their strategies and outperform competitors.


Theyre not working harder. Theyre working smarter.

Theyve found the balance between efficiency and personal connection, and its paying off: faster placements, happier clients, and more consistent growth.

2024 Version (The Hustle and Hope Edition):

8:00 AM: Coffee in one hand, job board tabs open in the other. Time to play Whos hiring?

9:00 AM: Manually scrolling through job boards, jotting down company names like a detective chasing leads.

10:30 AM: Writing outreach emails one by one, hoping they stand out in the sea of pitches your potential clients receive.

12:00 PM: Following up with a candidate from last week who just remembered theyre staying at their current job.

2:00 PM: Client calls, Do you have any new candidates? You flip through your notes and stall for time.

4:00 PM: Still scanning job boards, realizing youve only scratched the surface of your market.

6:00 PM: Updating your spreadsheet of outreach attempts and wondering if theres a better way to do this.


2025 Version (The Smooth Operator Edition):

8:00 AM: Coffee in one hand, notification in the other: 5 companies with new job postings that match your niche.

9:00 AM: Reviewing a curated list of open roles and pre-identified hiring managersAI has already mapped them for you.

10:30 AM: Automated, personalized outreach emails are sent based on the job descriptions. Responses start rolling in.

12:00 PM: Candidate outreach handled automatically. One less thing on your plate.

2:00 PM: Client calls, Do you have any new candidates? You confidently point them to a dashboard showing their live shortlist.

4:00 PM: Analyzing data to refine outreach strategies instead of manually chasing leads.

6:00 PM: Finishing the day with a clearer pipeline, higher engagement, and zero spreadsheet headaches.


The difference?

2024: Scanning job boards, sending cold emails, and crossing your fingers.
2025: Targeted leads, automated outreach, and actual results.


Which version of your day sounds better?

Your data is outdated.

Using the email-address you found on Apollo or ZoomInfo without revalidating it will lead to you wasting your time with writing emails and making phone calls into the void.

So to get your foundations right - check out these 2 providers we use the most:

Prospeo.io
- good coverage & cheap 
- has an API to integrate into your workflows/tools
- easy UI you can also use
- emails, phone numbers, SalesNav exports,... with your credits
- Chrome extension for quick one-off enrichments

Bonus tip:
With the domain search, you can just input a domain and it will return all the emails they have in their database for it.


BetterContact
- really good coverage since it's a ""waterfall provider""
- 20+ data sources
- only pay for validated data (does catch-all validation as well)
- has an API to integrate into your workflows


If you are unsure about your data quality, I can only recommend you to check these tools out.

(Let me know if you want to try them out and I'll hook you up with some extra credits >+)

It's about time to get your basics right and reach more potential clients!

urn:li:activity:7269664527267377152,"Here is how I scraped specific job boards for a niche recruitment agency (one-time vs recurring):

While scraping job boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, Stepstone, etc. is fine for most recruiters.

Some of our clients have really targeted ones for their ideal job openings/clients focused on their niche.

For them you'll not find that many API or pre-built scrapers, so let me tell you how to scrape them:


1ã One-Time

If you are looking to just get a bulk report of all current jobs on the board...

- download the ""Instant Data Scraper"" chrome extension for your Google Chrome browser (looks just like a Pokeball)
- go onto the job board website
- open the extension
- choose the ""Next"" button or check ""Infinite scrolling"" depending on if the job board has pagination or not
- let it run and export it as a csv-file


2ã Recurring

Do you always want to have the freshest jobs of that board on autopilot?...

- open the developer console on your browser
- copy the HTML of the site into ChatGPT
- prompt it to return Python code that loops through the board and returns the data points you need
- go onto Replit and host it as a web app
- now you can call your web app on a scheduled basis with Make or n8n and it will scrape all the jobs


=¡ Extra Steps (for the techies)

- set up a Clay table with a webhook source, that extracts the decision maker/contact mentioned in the job description or finds a DM if there is no one mentioned
- push the jobs via API call into the Clay table
- automate personalized outreach based on the job data like description via e-mail (Smartlead) or LinkedIn (lemlist)


Are you & your team tired of manually scraping job boards?

Of course, before diving in I assume you do the basics and check:
- is the company in my ICP
- who am I reaching out to
- what problems do they potentially have
- how can we help them
- ...

but to truly stand out you then need to get creative, which for example could mean to:
- create a unique landing page just for them and personalized
- send a personalized voice note
- write a handwritten letter (old-school I know)
- record a personalized video or image/gif


all of the above can be done on scale as well by using tools like:
- Webflow to create custom landing pages and fill in the data you sourced in Clay via API
- lemlist to send generic voice notes via LinkedIn (we also developed a workflow that can use a voice clone and create personalized voice notes based on a script - )
- Handwrytten to send letters at scale
- Sendspark to create personalized videos

In recruitment, personal connections are everything. 

But heres the thing: you dont have to sacrifice the human element to leverage technology. 

The right tools actually enhance personal connections by freeing up time for what matters most.


=¡ Let automation handle repetitive tasks like sourcing candidates, building lead lists, and sending follow-ups. 

This creates space for recruiters to focus on real conversations, understanding peoples goals, and building trust.


Recruitment is still a human-to-human business. 

The agencies that succeed wont be the ones that ignore technologytheyll be the ones that use it to amplify their human touch.


Automation helps you work smarter, but the human element drives success. Finding the balance is the key!

No problem - here is how you can steal it from your competitors on autopilot:

All you need are these 3 tools:
Trigify.io
Clay
lemlist

When starting out and building your personal brand on LinkedIn it might take some time.

To take the ""shortcut"" and still get new leads from day one - this automation helps you:

1. Social Engagement Tracking
- use Trigify.io to  set up social engagement tracking for a few profiles that already have a good reputation/following
- they should post regularly and have the same/similar ICP audience as you
- connect these with Clay

2. Qualification
- use Clay automatically filter out the people that you actually want to engage with from the tracked engagement
- normalized first name and other variables needed
- enrich some AI-personalization that is relevant (if you want... this also works without any fancy AI-personalization)

3. Connection & Conversation
- push the qualified leads to your lemlist campaign
- send automatic LinkedIn sequences that include connection requests, text messages, and maybe even voice messages

As everyone always says - ""Data is the new gold/oil""

But if everyone is getting their data from the same two databases, it's hard to be different, faster, and more accurate than your competitors.


So you should go to these niche-websites, directories, and do specific Google searches, and then use these tools to not manually copy&paste the data out...

Instant Data Scraper:
- free Google Chrome extension
- you can automate clicking ""Next"" buttons and scrape whole directories with thousands of entries without programming a manual scraper

Serper:
- automate Google searches at scale
- use site parameters for more accurate results
- integrate it in any flow via API request

Claygent:
- AI agent that can scrape websites/the internet for you
- you can prompt it in Clay with variables so each row has a unique prompt and you can define the output fields you want


Check the visual for the other 2 =@ 



So if you want to stay ahead of your competitors and don't want your employees be doing manual repetitive tasks - give these tools a try!

How many times did your recruiters hear this last month because someone else was faster?


Here's the harsh truth: While you're manually refreshing job boards, your competitors are already pitching their candidates.

The recruiting game has changed. 

The difference between winning and losing a placement often comes down to minutes, not hours.

Think about it:
- A new job gets posted
- 20+ recruiters spot it
- Everyone rushes to submit candidates
- The first quality submission often wins


But here's what top-performing recruitment firms are doing differently:
- They've automated job board monitoring
- Their systems instantly alert them to matching opportunities
- Their recruiters focus 100% on what matters: qualifying and pitching 
candidates


The result?
- They're first in the client's inbox
- Their recruiters make 3x more client calls per day
- Higher placement rates
- More revenue per consultant


Your recruiters should be building relationships, not scanning job boards.

The math is simple: 

Traditional approach: 
2 hours daily on job boards = 40 hours monthly of lost revenue 

Automated approach: 
0 hours on job boards = 40 extra hours for revenue-generating activities

Ready to stop leaving money on the table? 

Let's talk about setting up automated job board monitoring that delivers hot leads straight to your team. 

Your competitors are already doing it.

Ever wonder how pros search Google efficiently? 

It's all about search operators - special commands that narrow down the results.

Let me show you the most powerful ones:

<¯ Site-Specific Searches 
- Want to search just one website? 
- Use site:example,com keyword 
- Perfect for finding content on specific company websites or domains.

<¯ Exact Match Searching 
- Put phrases in quotes: ""exact phrase here"" 
- Forces Google to find that exact sequence of words. 
- Great for finding specific product names or quotes.

<¯ Exclude Terms 
- Don't want certain results? 
- Use -excludeKeyword 
- The minus sign removes results containing that word. 
- Example: python -snake (for programming, not reptiles!)

<¯ Advanced Combinations 
- The real power comes from combining operators: 
- site:linkedin,com ""hiring manager"" -recruiter 
- This finds hiring managers on LinkedIn while excluding recruiter profiles.

<¯ File Type Searches 
- Looking for specific documents? 
- filetype:pdf ""annual report"" 
- Finds PDFs containing ""annual report""

<¯ URL Word Search 
- Want URLs containing specific words? 
- Use inurl:careers 
- Perfect for finding career pages


Pro Tips:
- Use OR (in caps) between terms for either/or
- Use * as a wildcard
- Add before: and after: for date ranges
- Combine with intitle: to search page titles only


What used to take hours of manual filtering now takes seconds.

And you can even go one step further and automate this:
- Tools like Serper API can run these searches at scale
- Combine it in Clay with their Claygent to  AI to analyze results
- Process thousands of precise searches in minutes

Happy searching! =

With Google's recent announcement about leveraging more AI to filter out spam, the importance of highly relevant and qualified lists is increasing.

Besides deliverability with the right technical setup the lead list and copy play an important part.


Why does this matter?

¡ Improved Deliverability: 
Quality lists help you bypass spam filters.

¡ Higher Engagement Rates: 
Relevant contacts are more likely to interact with your content.

¡ Better ROI: 
Focusing on qualified leads saves time and resources (and needs less volume).

¡ Enhanced Reputation: 
Targeted outreach protects your brand image.


As marketers and sales professionals, we need to step up our game. 


Here are 7 powerful tools to help you build and maintain quality lead lists:

Apollo.io: Comprehensive B2B sales intelligence and engagement platform.

Ocean.io: Find lookalike companies to your clients/case studies

LinkedIn Sales Navigator: Advanced search and lead recommendations within probably the most B2B up-to-date database.

Apify: Web scraping and automation for data extraction.

Crunchbase: Detailed information on companies, including funding and key personnel.

BuiltWith: Technology profiling to identify potential leads based on their tech stack.

Harmonic: StartUp/Funding data.


Leverage these tools to stay ahead of AI filters and connect with the right prospects more effectively.

W But remember, it's not just about collecting data. 
The key is to use these tools to gain insights and create personalized, value-driven outreach strategies.

Here's what happened when we challenged conventional approaches:

- Launched 3 campaign angles on a Wednesday
- Thursday was a holiday in our target market
- Most prospects were self-employed
- Outreach included sending on Saturday


Our hypothesis? 

Holiday timing might not matter as much for solo entrepreneurs and even have a positive impact.



The results speak for themselves:

Campaign 1ã :

- Persona 1, scraped from Google Maps with Scrap io
- 354 leads contacted
- 4 positive replies

-> Doubling down on subject line B for 1st email (92 sent and 2 positive replies)


Campaign 2ã :

- Persona 1, scraped from Google Search results with Serper
- 408 leads contacted
- 4 positive replies

-> subject line B also performing better with 246 sent and 3 positive replies


Campaign 3ã :
- Persona 2, scraped from Google Maps
- 251 leads contacted
- 4 positive replies

-> Initially we thought this was the worse persona, but seems to outperform persona 1 so far.



Key takeaways:

- Test unconventional strategies

- Don't assume holidays always mean low engagement

- Understand your audience's work patterns

- subject lines and best practices in general may vary in each target country/industry



The biggest lesson? 

--> Test a lot and make data-driven decisions!!

What seemed like poor timing turned into a golden opportunity.

urn:li:activity:7247551816425467904,"Personal branding in sales is not a nice to have anymore.
Here's why and how =G

Your prospects are drowning in automated messages. 
AI SDRs are flooding inboxes all day long. 
Update your LI job and you're doomed.

Standing out is harder than ever. That's why personal branding is your secret weapon.


Here's what a killer personal brand does for you:

 Unlocks crazy inbound-led outbound flows 
 Builds trust before the first sales call 
 Positions you as the go-to expert 
 Nurtures leads in consideration 
 Makes closing deals easier 
 Shortens sales cycles

But you need to do it right. 

Here's the blueprint:

1ã Define your unique edge
What makes you different?
How do you help people solve problems?
What's your professional superpower?

2ã Create content that matters
Share insights, not pitches
Be the ""online consultant,"" not just another salesperson
Address real pain points your prospects face

3ã Engage authentically
Comment thoughtfully on others' posts
Reply to comments on your content
Start genuine conversations

4ã Commit to consistency
Show up regularly (it's a marathon, not a sprint)
Be patientgrowth starts slow but accelerates
Adapt based on what resonates with your audience

Pro tip: 
Use your engagement data smartly. It's like having a built-in lead gen tool.


The cost of not doing this? 
=I Losing valuable visibility to competitors 
=I Missing out on high-value opportunities 
=I Falling behind in a fast-moving market

Don't be that person playing catch-up... seriously!

Your future self (and sales pipeline) will thank you.

The setup is pretty straightforward.

1ã Scrape Google Maps listings, either with a tool like Apify or with a database like Scrap.


2ã Clean the data in Clay and write some relevant personalization based on their shop and your offer.

This could be a featured product, a case study, their bestselling item on the menu,...


3ã Get the contact data. 
- Most of the time the Google Maps listing already has some e-mail or phone number connected.
- Else you can try to let Claygent find a name or e-mail on their website and enrich it


4ã Send it.
- Push the data to Smartlead
- Include Spintax on top of the personalization for even better deliverability
- Connect Smartlead to your Slack channel with a few clicks


5ã Enjoy!
Watch the notifications of positive responses in Slack and ideally set up some subsequences to automatically handle a lot of the cases where you have a predefined response.


Are you looking to book meetings with relevant personas in your TAM, but don't have the time to build this system yourself?

Let us build the outreach engine into your workspace.

urn:li:ugcPost:7245027014229770242,"Are your sales teams struggling with time-consuming manual research?
 
This tool stack helps you automate finding almost every data point at scale:

We enrich well over 80,000 lead profiles each month.

Lead information is becoming outdated faster every day. 

Relying on manual research or a single data source isn't just risky - it's a major drain on your resources and budget.


Let's break it down:

Imagine you have a team of 4 SDRs. 

The average hourly rate for an SDR is about $25 (not including benefits and overhead). 
Each spends about 10 minutes researching every lead before outreach. 

If they research 20 companies per day, that's:
10 minutes * 20 companies * 4 SDRs = 800 minutes or 13.33 hours per day

That's 66.67 hours per week spent on manual research!

Now, let's calculate the cost: 
66.67 hours * $25/hour = $1,666.75 per week or about $6,667 per month

That's over $80,000 per year spent just on manual research!


But the true cost goes beyond just salaries. 

Consider the opportunity cost:

If these SDRs could instead spend that time on actual outreach, and each SDR can make even 1 more meaningful contact per hour (accounting for the more in-depth nature of these interactions), that's: 

66.67 hours * 1 contact = 66.67 additional potential leads reached per week

Assuming a 2% conversion rate and an average deal size of $10,000: 

66.67 additional contacts * 2% * $10,000 = $13,334 in potential additional pipeline per week


That's almost $700,000 in potential additional pipeline per year that you're missing out on by having your SDRs stuck doing manual research!

See how crucial efficient research processes are?

- The best CTAs initiate a conversation, not just book a meeting.
- Lower the reply barrier to boost your response rates.
- Align your CTA with the prospect's stage in the buyer's journey.
- Use softer CTAs for first-touch emails, stronger ones for engaged prospects.


Of course, the CTA is just one part besides the subject line, your offer, the list,... and many other things to get right - but a really important one.


Which kind of CTA has been the most successful for you?

- LinkedIn and ""corporate influencing"" is becoming a trend for big companies as well, as they see the value/awareness the personal brands of their employees can bring to the company

- there are so many other levels and strategies in marketing except from email/cold outbound, but still a lot of parallels and tricks you can adapt from each other

- sales pitches in person are even harder than via Google Meet (at least for me lol)

- networking in person therefore is even nicer than just via Slack or Google Meet (shoutout Alexander - was great to have a chat today)


Probably many other learnings but looking forward to more expos in the future and then also attending some more international conferences like SaaStr next year.

Have you ever found yourself with just a profile picture of a potential client? 

I've developed a method to turn that single image into a valuable lead.


“ Here's my step-by-step process “

1ã Gather profile pictures
- Source from Slack communities, Facebook groups, or other platforms
- Use tools like PhantomBuster for efficient collection

2ã Use Google Lens for image search
- Create a Google Lens URL with the image URL as a variable
- This allows you to search the web for matching images

3ã Run an Apify actor
- This tool helps find websites where Google Lens located the same image

4ã Identify LinkedIn profiles
- Look for results that include ""/in/"" in the URL
- Verify the full name matches your initial data

5ã Enrich data with Clay
- Use Clay to find personal and company information
- Locate email addresses and other contact details


The power of this workflow is that it lets you start with just a picture and end up with a full profile of a potential lead.


Why this matters:
- Uncover leads from sources your competitors might miss
- Find prospects with high intent based on their online presence
- Expand your reach beyond traditional lead generation methods


Get creative in your lead sourcing process!

your time-to-response.


When I launched some initial outbound campaigns for ourselves, I was thrilled to see positive responses flying in.

but excitement quickly turned to frustration as I watched potential deals slip away. 


Out of 27 promising leads over 6 weeks, only 14 calls were booked, with 3 no-shows. 

The rest? 
They disappeared.

The cause? 
Our painfully slow response time.


In today's business world, every hour a lead waits for a reply diminishes your chances of converting them. 

We had no system in place - no notifications, no streamlined process. 

Just rookie mistakes that cost us an estimated $45,000 in potential pipeline.


The solution was clear:

We needed a robust reply handling framework. Here's what we implemented:

1ã Instant notifications:
Alerts now pop up on our screens the moment a lead responds.


2ã Rapid response protocol: 
We've cut our reply time down to minutes, not hours or days.

3ã CRM integration: 
Automations sync data back to our CRM in real-time.

4ã Edge case handling: 
Systems to manage scenarios like wrong contacts or company departures.

Remember, getting a positive response is only half the battle. 
The real win comes when that meeting is locked into your calendar.

I've attached a detailed flowchart of our new response handling system.

urn:li:activity:7239218580809031680,"I need your guys opinion:

Yesterday, I shared our core tech stack for cold outbound campaigns. 

Someone commented, asking why we use separate tools instead of an all-in-one solution - likening it to using a camera, GPS, and flashlight instead of a smartphone.


Here's my take: 

I prefer tools that focus on one area. 

Why? 

Because they tend to become really good at what they do. 

Especially in cold email outreach, where changes are frequent, I believe there isn't a comprehensive all-in-one solution... yet.


But it got me thinking - this is a topic worth discussing further.

So, I'm curious: 
What's your stance on specialized tools versus all-in-one solutions, particularly in the realm of cold outbound marketing?


Do you prefer:
- A suite of specialized tools, each mastering its niche?
- An all-in-one platform that tries to do it all?
- A hybrid approach?

For any of you that don't know what RB2B is...
It basically allows you to de-anonymize US visitors that are on your website.


If you connect these new insights and data points, you can imagine what kind of automations are possible:
- automatically get notified with warm prospects who looking for more information on your website via Slack
- enrich and qualify the leads in Clay to check if they are in your ICP
- write a personalized message based on the subpages they visit
- on auto-pilot reach out to them via LinkedIn or e-mail just minutes after they were on your website

(Most of the times we don't really tell them we know that they checked out the website so the ""WOW"" effect is even bigger)


But here is the problem..

If you have it installed at the header of every page of your website, it will trigger for a lot of people if you have decent traffic

who maybe are just scrolling through your homepage but aren't really interested in your services or an ICP-fit.

> This will lead to you burning more credits and your RB2B subscription getting more expensive


So here is what we did with our client:
> installed the pixel only on specific subpages, where the leads are more likely to be interested in their services
> this could be some case-studies, blog articles,... you name it

By implementing this simple hack we've gotten way more relevant and hot leads while not needing to upgrade the RB2B plan.

urn:li:activity:7235238794600321027,"There are 2 types of prospects: 

The ones that are hard to find and reach out to
vs.
the ones that are easy to do so and everybody does.


Let's talk about the ""easy to find"" prospects:

These are the people with a strong online presence. 
You can quickly find them in databases like Apollo. 
It seems great because everyone can reach them easily. 

But this comes with some problems:
- Their inboxes are always full. 
- Your message might get lost in the crowd - it's harder to stand out.
- They're good with technology and often use strong spam filters.
- They might report your email as spam more easily, due to being more tech-savvy
- You're competing with many other businesses for their attention.


Now, think about the ""hard to find"" prospects, like local businesses you might find on Google Maps:

- They have less online visibility, which means less competition for you.
- Your outreach can be more personal and relevant to them.
- They get fewer cold emails, so they're more likely to read and respond to yours.
- You can often meet them face-to-face and build stronger connections.
- You might find hidden opportunities that others miss



So next time you're building a list - try to go for the local businesses as well, by either:
- utilizing databases like Scrap.io
or
- implement scraping via Apify

Here you can use AI and go even beyond the filters available in SalesNavigator.(


Step 3: 
Personalize(your messaging

Once you have your qualified list of candidates you need to think of a conversational messaging you can use on LinkedIn. 
Don't try to be salesy.(
You can use Twain to help you come up with some good copies that start conversations.


Step 4: 
LinkedIn Outreach

The last step is to send them to a lemlist campaign, where you can automate the connection request, and once they accept you can send them a personalized snippet followed by a generic voice message.
 
Because of the personalized snippet before nobody will think this is automated. And it will make you stand out from the inboxes.

Trust me, I worked in IT and have gotten a lot of copy-and-paste messages from recruiters that had no relevance and I never answered.

We also did this for some campaigns of our clients and got great feedback and positive replies.((

Why we changed our slogan and why this resonates more with our customers:

Our old slogan ""Say hello to 100x strategic growth."" wasn't quite hitting the mark.

(actually, it's still on our website, but we will publish the new one in the next 1-2 days, so this is already a spoiler)


Why I think the new slogan is spot on:

- It tackles a real problem our customers face - boosting sales without overspending.
- ""Grow your pipeline"" focuses on increasing potential deals and opportunities.
- ""Not your headcount"" shows we understand companies want to scale without massive hiring sprees and complexity.
- It neatly sums up our value: helping businesses expand sales efficiently and predictably.


Scaling Sales is about smart growth, not just hiring more people.

Many companies think the answer to selling more is simply hiring more salespeople. 
But that approach can be costly and doesn't always pay off.


The real key to growth is building a smooth, repeatable process for finding and closing deals. 

This involves:
- Using technology to boost your team's productivity
- Analyzing data to pinpoint the most promising leads
- Creating a step-by-step playbook that consistently delivers results
- Improving how you turn interested leads into actual customers

When you focus on fine-tuning your sales process, you can achieve much faster growth without the need to constantly expand your team.

That's the essence of our new slogan.

Here's how to reclaim your evenings and more free time on different tasks with Clay and Apify:

1ã Analyze websites in bulk: 
No more clicking through hundreds of sites manually. 
Get comprehensive data on multiple prospects simultaneously.

2ã Track keyword rankings automatically: 
Say goodbye to tedious spreadsheets. 
These tools can monitor rankings for you, flagging opportunities and threats.

3ã Generate personalized outreach messages: 
Imagine reaching out to each prospect with a message that speaks directly to their SEO pain points - without spending hours crafting each one.

4ã Uncover hidden opportunities: 
Spot patterns and opportunities in data that might take you days to find manually.

5ã Scale your outreach efforts: 
With the time saved, you can reach out to more prospects or spend more time nurturing promising leads.

The best part? All this happens while you focus on what matters - strategizing, closing deals, or ... actually enjoying your free time.

Reach more prospects, and ultimately, grow your agency without burning out.


What's your biggest time-sink when it comes to prospect research and outreach?

Your cold email is perfect... until the CTA. =,

The right call to action can make or break your outreach. 

After analyzing thousands of cold emails, we've identified 15 CTAs that consistently drive responses.

Here they are, categorized for easy use:

1ã Reply Focused

""Does this align with your current priorities?""
""Is this an area you're focusing on?""
""Worth considering?""
""Mind sharing?""


2ã Interest Focused

""Would it help your team if they could [specific action]?""
""Interested in discovering how [X] can [Y]?""
""Want to take a look at how we [X]?""
""How would this impact your team's performance?""


3ã Negative Perspective (Psychology hack >à)

""Would it be a terrible idea to...?""
""Opposed to learning more?""
""Is there a downside to giving this a chance?""

4ã Resource Focused

""Mind if I send you a case study to explain how?""
""Interested in a quick video showing how to [X]?""
""Can I send a short video showing how it works?""


The best CTAs start a conversation, not book a meeting. 
Lower the barrier to reply and you'll see your response rates improve.


Always align your CTA with the prospect's likely stage in the buyer's journey. 
A first-touch email should have a much softer CTA than a follow-up to an engaged prospect.

urn:li:activity:7221446563854778369,"5 reasons you need a content + automation strategy

Your professional brand is your most valuable asset.

And there's no better place to build it than LinkedIn.

But it's not just about posting content.

It's about strategically engaging with your audience and turning those interactions into meaningful connections.


Here's why you need to combine content creation with smart automation:

1. Visibility is King =Q 
Consistent posting keeps you on your network's radar. The more you share, the more opportunities you create for people to discover and engage with you.

2. Establish Authority <Æ 
Regular, high-quality content positions you as a thought leader in your field. It's your chance to showcase your expertise and unique insights.

3. Network Growth <1 
Engaging content naturally attracts like-minded professionals, expanding your network with quality connections.

4. Engagement = Opportunity <¯ 
Every like, comment, or share is a potential door to new opportunities - be it partnerships, job offers, or client leads.

5. The Automation Advantage ™ 
Here's where it gets interesting. Imagine having a system that:
- Tracks who engages with your content
- Sends personalized connection requests or messages to these engaged users
- Nurtures these new connections with tailored follow-ups

This isn't just a time-saver; it's a game-changer.
You're not just broadcasting content; you're strategically building relationships at scale.


Getting Started =€ 
- Commit to a consistent posting schedule
- Focus on providing value in every post
- Implement an engagement tracking tool
- Set up automated (but personalized) outreach

If you need help either on the content side or the automation/personalization part - send me a DM and I will show you what we can set up for you.

But what if you could combine their strengths?

How to build an inbound-led outbound strategy in 7 days.


Let's face it: traditional marketing methods aren't cutting it anymore.

Inbound marketing? It's like watching paint dry. Sure, it brings in quality leads, but at a glacial pace.

Outbound? It's the used car salesman of the digital age. Effective, but about as welcome as a telemarketer at dinner time.

But here's the kicker: what if you could have your cake and eat it too?

Enter the inbound-led outbound approach. It's like the marketing equivalent of a mullet - business in the front, party in the back.


Here's how we built our strategy in just one week:

Day 1: Data Deep Dive 
We aggregated data from our inbound efforts. Website visitors, content engagement, social media interactions - all in one place.

Day 2: Persona Perfection 
We analyzed this data to refine our ideal customer profile. Turns out, our best prospects weren't who we thought they were.

Day 3: Content Curation 
We cherry-picked our top-performing inbound content. These became our secret weapons for outbound.

Day 4: Personalization at Scale 
Using Clay's enrichment features, we created personalized outreach messages. Each one felt like it was crafted just for them - because it was.

Day 5: Trigger Identification 
We set up alerts for key events in what we call a ""Relevancy Waterfall"" - funding rounds, new hires, open jobs... These became our perfect conversation starters.

Day 6: Channel Optimization 
We mapped out a multi-channel approach. LinkedIn, email, and phone - all working in harmony, guided by our inbound insights.

Day 7: Launch and Learn 
We kicked off our first campaign and set up analytics to track everything. Real-time adjustments became our new norm.


The results? 
Meeting bookings went through the roof.

But don't take my word for it. Try it yourself. Your future self (and your revenue) will thank you.

In case you missed our webinar yesterday together with Clay & Patrick, I gave you a quick rundown of the workflow I showcased in the video.

Basically how this works:
1ã Scrape prospects and their profile picture
In this case, we did it for Slack community members with PhantomBuster but I could imagine this will also work on Facebook groups or similar.
2ã Construct a Google Lens URL with the image URL as a variable
You usually have a link where the image is hosted, we need to use this as a parameter for the Google Lens search
3ã Run an Apify actor
This will get you all the websites where Google Lens found the same image
4ã Extract and verify that you found a LinkedIn profile
You can check with their full name and that the link contains ""/in/"" so it's a personal profile
5ã Enrich them in Clay
Go ahead and enrich their personal or company information, find their e-mails just like you are used with Clay

This workflow enables you to just start with a picture as a data point, which is pretty mindblowing.

urn:li:activity:7218890886154203136,"Protecting your e-mail reputation: why you maybe should rethink your domain/mailbox setup

In the world of email marketing and outreach, your domain reputation is everything. 
It's the key that determines whether your messages land in the inbox or get lost in the spam folder. 

But here's a critical mistake many companies make: 
using a single domain, often their primary business domain, for all types of email communications.

This approach is like putting all your eggs in one very fragile basket. 


Here's why it's risky:

1ã Vulnerability to Reputation Damage: 
If just one mailbox associated with your domain gets compromised or flagged for spam, it can drag down the reputation of your entire domain. This means every email you send - from marketing campaigns to critical business communications - could be affected.

2ã Limited Scalability: 
As your outreach efforts grow, so does the strain on your domain's reputation. Using a single domain doesn't allow for the flexibility and segmentation needed for sophisticated email strategies.

3ã Difficulty in Isolating Issues: 
When problems arise, it's challenging to pinpoint and address the source without affecting your entire email operation.



So, what's the smarter approach?

 Implement a Multi-Domain Strategy: 
Use separate domains for different types of email activities. This isolates risks and allows for more targeted reputation management.

 Protect Your Primary Domain: 
Never use your main business domain for cold outreach or high-volume marketing campaigns. Reserve it for important business communications and warm leads.

 Create a Scalable Infrastructure: 
Set up multiple domains and mailboxes in a way that allows you to contain potential issues and scale your efforts without compromising overall deliverability.

 Monitor and Adapt: 
Regularly check the health of each domain and mailbox. Be ready to adjust your strategy based on performance metrics.


By adopting this approach, you're not just protecting your email deliverability - you're setting up a robust foundation for all your cold outbound motion.

It's about thinking long-term and creating a system that grows with your business.

After 70+ discovery calls, one thing's clear: 
Sales is changing at lightning speed. 


Here are 5 crucial shifts I've observed:

1ã From Capturing to Creating Demand
- Markets are saturated 
- Top sales teams now focus on creating awareness 
- Content creation is becoming a critical sales asset

2ã From Quotas to Relationships 
- Yes, quotas still matter (we all need to eat!) - but the path has changed 
- Long-term relationship nurturing is the new bread and butter

3ã From Pushy Outbound to Educational Outreach
- Email remains effective for booking meetings - but the hard sell is out 
- Focus on selling the value of the meeting itself 
- Follow-ups should provide additional insights

4ã From Spray-and-Pray to Trigger-Based Engagement 
- Generic mass outreach is dead 
- Use intent signals and triggers 
- Relevance beats basic personalization every time

5ã From Volume-Only to Quality-at-Scale 
- Sales tech is no longer optional - It's about making quality outreach scalable 
- Don't get left behind by outdated methods 
- Embrace tools that make you faster and smarter


The businesses that adapt to these shifts aren't just surviving  they're thriving. 
They're claiming market share from those stuck in the past.

Ever wonder what your competitors' followers could do for your business?
 
Well, we just found out, and the results are pretty exciting.


Here's what we did for one of our clients:

1ã Identified a key competitor with a strong LinkedIn presence
2ã Scraped their follower list 
3ã Enriched the data using Clay
4ã Crafted relevant & personalized outreach messages
5ã Launched the campaign in Smartlead

The results? See for yourself in the image below.

Key takeaway:
~ 3% prospect to positive response rate


But here's the real kicker: This approach not only yielded great results but also provided invaluable insights into our client's target audience.

And this was just the start with a sublist of followers - so much more volume to come for this! =€ 


The lesson? Sometimes, your best prospects are hiding in plain sight. You just need to know where to look and how to approach them.

What unconventional tactics have you used in your outbound campaigns?

It allows you to build out a people table inside of Clay with relevant personas.
Or even sync it with your CRM to show your current contacts.

With the new event type table you can then monitor those people if they update their LinkedIn profile and work at a new company.

They will then automatically get pushed into the event table and it's time for the usual Clay magic. 
- enrich their new email address
- research the new company
- write a personalized message
- ...

This opens up 2 potential scenarios:
You can reach out to the person with the new role
You can reach out to the old company based on the skill gap
Plus you can get creative and automate a lot of workflows like you are used from Clay.

Imagine burning a stack of cash while your sales team watches in horror. 
That's essentially what you're doing with low-quality leads.

Your business is a high-performance machine. Each component adds value, but the fuelyour leadsdetermines how smoothly it runs. So why are you still using the bargain-bin stuff?


Here's what happens when you neglect lead qualification and targeting:

L SDRs waste time on fruitless discovery calls 
L Quota pressure leads to booking low-quality meetings 
L AEs struggle with prospects who don't have a real problem to solve
L Customers get sold solutions they don't need 
L Churn rates skyrocket, and negative reviews pour in 
L The vicious cycle: SDRs face even more resistance to booking meetings 

It's a nightmare scenario that's hard to reverse.


The Solution: Targeted Lead Generation <¯

1ã Qualify leads before outreach
2ã Address pain points in initial communications 
3ã Implement a value-focused nurturing process


The result?

 SDRs engage with qualified prospects
 More discovery calls lead to meaningful processes
 AEs close deals with real impact
 Client satisfaction increases
 Sales teams earn more, boosting morale =°

Intrigued? You should be because the role of automation in modern outbound isn't what you think.

Forget the soulless spam bots of yesteryear. 
Today's AI-powered outreach is the secret weapon of top performers. 

Here's the kicker: it's making sales more human, not less.


Sound paradoxical? Let me break it down...

=¡ Smart Prospecting: AI sifts through data to find your perfect prospects. No more spray and pray!

=¡Personalization at Scale: ""Hey Sarah, saw your post about supply chain issues..."" beats ""Dear Sir/Madam"" any day.

=¡Perfect Timing: Tools track when prospects are most likely to engage. No more guesswork.

=¡Multi-Channel Magic: Seamlessly blend email, social, and calls for a cohesive experience.

=¡Real-Time Adaptation: Systems adjust based on prospect behavior. It's like having a sixth sense.


The golden rule? Automation shines when it empowers meaningful conversations, not replaces them.

Use tech for the grunt work. Let your team focus on what matters: building real relationships.

urn:li:activity:7211284469880680450,"Inbound vs Outbound: Why the most successful companies are blending both (and how)

The age-old debate of inbound vs. outbound marketing is finally coming to an end. But not in the way you might think.

Here's the truth: The most successful companies aren't choosing sides  they're masterfully blending both approaches. 

And the results? 
Pretty darn amazing.


Why the combination works:

=I Comprehensive coverage: Inbound catches those actively searching, while outbound reaches potential customers who don't even know they need you yet.
=I Faster results: While inbound builds over time, outbound can generate immediate leads and conversations.
=I Data synergy: Insights from inbound inform outbound targeting, and vice versa.
=I Brand reinforcement: Outbound touches support inbound messaging, creating a cohesive brand experience.


So, how are top companies making this work?

¡ They're using intent data from inbound to fuel hyper-targeted outbound campaigns.
¡ Content created for inbound gets repurposed into personalized outbound touchpoints.
¡ Sales and marketing teams are fully aligned, sharing insights across both channels.
¡ They're building robust attribution models to understand the full customer journey.


= The key? It's not about inbound OR outbound. 

It's about creating a seamless experience for your potential customers, meeting them wherever they are in their journey.

My challenge to you: 
Take a hard look at your marketing mix. 
Are you leaning too heavily on one approach? 
How could a more balanced strategy drive growth for your business?

and how you can do it too:

Tired of hitting API rate limits? 

I've got a solution that's both clever and powerful: 
Hosting your own Flask web app on Replit that acts as your custom API endpoint.


Here's why this is useful:

=I Bypass rate limits: By adding offset and wait commands, you can spread out your requests and avoid hitting those pesky limits.

=I Custom functionality: Implement complex, multi-API steps that would be impractical or not possible with simple API calls. When having the freedom to code on top of the API calls you can make some really cool stuff happen.

=I Cost-effective: Replit offers free hosting for small projects, making this accessible to developers of all levels.

=I Scalable: As your needs grow, you can easily upgrade your Replit plan or migrate to a more robust hosting solution.


A quick overview of how to get started:

1ã Create a Flask app in Python
2ã Implement your custom API logic
3ã Deploy on Replit
4ã Use your new endpoint in your projects

This approach has been a game-changer for my workflows, allowing me to create tools and automations that were previously out of reach.

- Flooding more prospects without strategy
- Sticking to the same old copy

And BAM!
- Domains get burned
- Emails dive straight into spam
- Appointments? Forget about 'em

= The secret? Optimize your email-to-lead ratio first.

How? 
- Experiment with fresh angles
- Craft new, captivating copy

Got a low email-to-lead ratio? Perfect. Now, stick to the playbook:

1) Aim for a bounce rate under 2%
2) Gradually increase volume, but spread it out
3) Blacklist unsubscribers immediately
4) Embrace spintax for variety
5) Send short, sweet, and personalized emails

Every day, over 3 billion emails are sent. In this crowded space, standing out requires more than just the basics.

Everyone can use Apollo to quickly search and build a list, targeting the same people as everyone else.

The result?

A flood of emails hitting the same inboxes, often leading to mediocre results.


Your prospects' mailboxes are overflowing with offers. We've all seen those messages asking, Can you handle 15 more leads this month? 

Prospects are tired of these repetitive pitches.


If your message doesn't stand out, it gets ignored. 

Competing in this environment isn't ideal.


This is where creativity comes in. 

There are still many untapped sources to find prospects who: 
 Arent bombarded with emails daily. 
 Desperately need your solutions.

Consider niche sites, local directories, government lists, specific company databases, and marketplaces. 

Lead sourcing isnt limited to LinkedIn and Apollo. 

The entire World Wide Web is waiting to be explored.


Here's what you need to do:

Put in the extra effort to find that untapped goldmine of leads.

Learn how to scrape data. 

There are numerous tools available: 
Ï Instant Data Scraper -> Free
Ï Clay Chrome extension -> Sources data directly into Clay

Once you have the data:
Open Clay and get started.

¡Import your CSV into a new table.
¡Enrich the data as needed.
¡Find contacts and emails.
¡Start sending relevant messages.

4ã Personalized Outreach Sequences - Every message we send out is crafted with the recipient in mind. From the first 'Hello' to every follow-up, we make sure it hits the right note, using tools like Smartlead or lemlist to build it out. 

5ã Automation Systems - Our secret sauce? Letting AI and automation take the wheel for routine tasks. This means everything from content creation to reactivating those cold leads is done seamlessly, giving us more time to focus on what matters. 


Why does this combination work wonders? Because each element boosts the others, spinning a flywheel of success that just keeps on going.

When checking out my experience you are gonna notice that I spend most of my time after school studying or working in IT.

While starting in more like a Software Engineer role I pivoted with my master's degree more into the world of AI because it fascinated me.

That's when I ended up working as a Data Scientist, meeting really great and smart people in AI and learning a lot.


Why I still think it was worth it, coding and training my own AI models for the work with No-Code tools nowadays:

¡ With a technical background I can get used to tools and understand them pretty quickly
¡ More advanced steps like some coding formulas or API calls are nothing new for me
¡ I know how the AI models work under the hood, so I know some tips&tricks to prompt them for the desired output
¡ If a tool has some boundaries I can jump in and build some simple custom-coded solutions

Our secret weapon for gathering data from multiple sources and the web at scale. Clay helps us personalize outreach by scraping specific information from any website, saving us hundreds of hours each month and making the impossible possible.

2ã Smartlead
Sending emails is a huge part of our core business. That's why we use the industry-leading tool Smartlead to set up campaigns for us and our clients. It offers great deliverability, a mail warmup feature, and transparent active lead-based pricing, making it our favorite choice.

3ã PhantomBuster
We use LinkedIn heavily for trigger-based outreach. PhantomBuster opens LinkedIn's black box to engage with potential leads when they interact with our profiles. We automate this by scheduling Phantom runs and integrating it with Clay. This opens up powerful use cases.

4ã Airtable
We use AirTable for databases, reporting interfaces, and entire applications. Its simplicity and high functionality make it perfect for putting our data to work and making data-driven decisions.

5ã Slack
It keeps our internal and external communication streamlined and transparent. We use a lot of Block Kit components to build workflows triggered within Slack, extending its functionality beyond communication.

urn:li:activity:7204751844231757824,"How I help recruiting companies to stand out in the LinkedIn Inbox and get them interested, qualified candidates to place at a new company:


Normally you would expect me to pitch you some AI tool or personalization trick...

but this time the main focus is on sending voice messages. <™


As I worked in IT and as a Data Scientist in the past I know the struggle of getting pitch slapped with a copy-paste job description.

A wall of text for a role where just one keyword matches my experience in the past. L 


To avoid that and be different from other recruiters we helped one of our clients to set up this automation:

1ã We source their ideal candidate via LinkedIn Sales Navigator. (For example only 2-3 years experience in a full-time job, bachelor/masters degree in IT)

2ã We use PhantomBuster to scrape the results and send them into a Clay table for further enrichment.

3ã In Clay we source their e-mail addresses, qualify, and personalize them.

4ã They are then automatically sent into a lemlist campaign (can also use La Growth Machine for this)


The magic is happening in the lemlist campaign...

Once a candidate accepts the connection request he gets a personalized text message like:

Hey {firstName}, I saw you were working as a {jobTitle} at {companyName} for {jobDuration}.

Then the message stops and we send a pre-recorded voice message just a few minutes after that.


This makes the candidate curious on what the voice note might say and they give it a listen.

In the audio, we told our client to start with something like ""Thought it would be more personal to record you a quick voice message.""

After that, he explains his offer.

Combining it with the personalized snippet beforehand - almost nobody will think it's automated =	 


This has gotten great results so far and I like this approach way more than using AI to generate the voice message.

I just think they still don't sound very human-like. >

This was the question a friend of mine recently asked me...

These are the results and learning since starting posting on LinkedIn end of April:=G


So 6 weeks ago I started out with just around 300 connections from my network and recent jobs.

Since then I managed to get 65k+ impressions on my post.

I was able to 3x my followers and am happy to provide helpful content around lead generation, Clay, and AI in sales to over 940 followers today.

(hoping to grow that of course further =@)


But if you look behind those numbers.

I made a ton of great connections and partnerships in my network that I love working together with on a daily basis.

I learned and love learning from one another on here and supporting each other in growing. =› 


And of course in the end it opened a lot of conversations through Inbound messages, which ultimately led to us getting a lot of new clients.


Please take this as encouragement if you are not already starting to publish helpful content and grow your network, to start doing it.

It may be cringe starting out, not knowing what works and getting no likes.

But in the end, you will learn from it and you will never know who is watching your content and might be 1 post away from booking a call with you! (

It's super important! = 

Ever got an offer that just misses the mark? Yeah, we all have. 

But when you hit the nail on the head, knowing exactly what your prospect is facing? 

That's when the magic happens. < 

It's not just an email; it's understanding, value, and timing all rolled into one.


And guess what? It boosts your chances of landing that sales call. 

Now, I won't sugarcoat itthe legwork of sifting through data to find that golden moment? 

Tough. Exhausting, even.

But what if I told you there's a shortcut? =€ 

With Clay, you can automate the hunt for those perfect timing signals. 


Here's a sneak peek:

1ã Job Postings: The signal of growth. Notice a company scaling? That's your cue. Offer them a ladder (your solution) as they grow, without adding to the chaos.

2ã Leadership Changes: A new person in a leadership role often means new directions and new opportunities for you to offer solutions that match their updated vision.

3ã Tech Adoption: Spot a company leveling up their tech? It means they're ripe for your cutting-edge, AI-driven tools to make their operations smoother. Plus they seem to have some budget to spent, if you are able to help them with their pain points.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg.


There are so many ways to utilize relevant timing in building your lead lists.

I will prepare some Clay tables to show them more in detail... =@ 

Which one would you like to see?

Also curious if these signals have worked in your strategy - let's chat below! =G

urn:li:activity:7198993504180535296,"How can you get as many touchpoints with your prospects as possible over different channels


If you are a B2B business your potential clients are most likely on LinkedIn. 

They might also use a business email (Im pretty sure about that and if not they might dont have the money to pay you either)

So by knowing they are using both of these channels you should be as visible across these channels as possible and utilizing both for connecting with them.


Its called multi-channel outreach.

We usually follow a flow like this:
- Connect on LinkedIn
- Send a first message
- If they respond we start a conversation 
- If they don't accept the connection request or answer the message we try to start a convo via email
- Do follow-ups on both

What sounds easy&is in practice *drumroll* not easy.


As LinkedIn is pretty limited in terms of automation compared to email we were looking for a way to build these conditions.

We tried
- Using a spreadsheet as a managing table 
- An AirTable that triggers message flows
- Doing it manually with a schedule 

Each of them required manual handling.

Cost too much time and wasnt scalable.


Luckily there are tools that can manage both channels.

These are the two tools that I had the best results when it comes to usability and efficiency.

La Growth Machine & lemlist
- Work with identities (connect LinkedIn + e-mail)
- Have great workflow templates (with Voice message features, custom conditions, liquid syntax,..)
- Integrate with Zapier and have webhooks for fancy automations

And of course, they are natively integrated into Clay.


Have you tried multichannel yet?

urn:li:activity:7198616200690495488,"The easiest way to identify a skill gap in a prospect company...


...and how to create a personalized email opener.


Skill gaps are a powerful trigger signal.

It means that a company is missing a crucial skill in their team.

They are missing it and you are offering it.

Great match with relevance.


Let me give you an example.

We automate a lot of tasks that SDRs usually do to build pipeline.

If a company has no or only a few SDRs...

...or is hiring for one...

...it's a trigger for us.



Why?

Because we can reach out with a relevant message that
- hits a current pain point -> lack of skill in the team
- comes at the right time -> if they are hiring
- shows we did our research -> by adding personalization



Here is how we do this in Clay:

Step 1:
Import a list of companies into Clay from LinkedIn or Apollo.

Step 2:
Find contacts at these companies with roles like SDR, BDR, etc.

We look for everything related to doing outreach.

Step 3:
In the next step, we check if they are currently hiring for a sales role.

If we find an open sales job we prioritize the account.

Step 4:
Then we use find keyword steps and formulas that return the number of roles they have.

If they only have one sales role in their team we extract the first name of them.

In the next step, we normalize the role names and first names with AI so they don't appear weird in the final copy.

Now we can write some copy.

Step 5: 
Let AI write a personalized email line. 

Something like... 

Hey {first name}, saw you have a team of two SDRs and was wondering how they manage high outreach volume&

...or...

""{first name} - how does {SDR first name} handle high outreach volumes? Can imagine it gets quite busy sometimes...""

...or...

{first name} - I saw you don't have any SDRs in your team. How do you reach out to potential leads at the moment?



Want to use skill gaps for your own outreach?

I've built this exact play for you.

And you can adjust it to your own business.

This is how you can use it:

using phrases like these in your messaging can kill your outbound campaigns

So I hope you are still reading this = 


Your leads get hundreds of emails every week

If you want to stand out, you have to be original and provide value for them.

Phrases that don't provide value or are putting you in an awkward position are:

L ""I know you're busy, but..""
L ""Can I get 15 mins of your time?""
L ""Not sure if you saw my previous email..""
L ""Just following up""
L ""I hope this email finds you well""


Instead, you should try to check the following points in your messaging:

 cut the fluff
 short and relevant to the lead
 give them a solution with your offer for their pain points
 make the lead magnet a no-brainer
 provide value


Include these into your copywriting, avoid the phrases, and watch the response rate take off!

I always read the message out loud and imagine I'm in their shoes.

If I didn't cringe while doing that and would say ""Yes"" to the offer, only then I'd start the campaign.

Here are the 5 core components of our lead gen engine (in no particular order):

1ã Relevant Content

Content is crucial. While not mandatory, it amplifies results. It guides our audience through the funnel, educates about our services, nurtures leads, and keeps us top of mind. Even when theyre not actively looking, theyre watching.


2ã Data Enrichment

To qualify and reach out, you need robust data. We track LinkedIn engagement with PhantomBuster, source account lists from Apollo.io or in Clay, and enrich them using various providers within Clay. The more and better data you have, the better you can qualify and personalize with AI.


3ã Lead Pre-Qualification & Intents

We don't spray and pray. Were like a sniper, scoping for the perfect target at the perfect time, firing only when all stars align. ( This approach significantly increases the chances of a positive reply, making outreach relevant.


4ã Personalized Outreach Sequences

Before sending any message, we ensure it's personalized, whether its a first outreach or a follow-up. We carefully enrich data to tailor the copy, making it resonate with the recipient. Then, we reach out on the appropriate channels using tools like Smartlead or lemlist for example.


5ã Automation Systems

From AI-powered content systems to CRM customizations that operate on autopilot and follow-up automations to reactivate dead leads, we ensure tasks get done through automation. We use tools like Make, Zapier, or custom code solutions.

Why do these components work so well together? Each amplifies the others, creating a flywheel effect. =«

You can start with the steps above, spend hours connecting the dots, or...

From my experience, sales team setups vary wildly - some are slick, efficient operations, others... not so much, just barely hanging on.

I've chatted with various sales leaders recently, and despite their different methods, they all shared one major issue: too much time spent on prospecting and qualifying leads. 

This means not only poor outreach but also wasted time that could've been better spent elsewhere.

I reassure you that it doesnt have to be this way.


AI is revolutionizing the way sales teams operate - from prospecting to moving deals along the pipeline.

A single SDR that embraces the right tech tools is going to leap ahead of those sales teams sticking with outdated, manual methods.


Heres why tomorrow's top sales teams will outshine the traditional ones:

’ Quick, quality leads
Tools like Clay can sift through hundreds of data points to find and qualify leads in seconds. No more misaligned outreach or random efforts. Train your team to use these tools for building pre-qualified lists and tailoring outreach.

’ Focus more on relationships
Imagine a tool like Sybill that can join your sales calls and handle all the details, letting your team concentrate on the conversation. Say goodbye to manual note-taking.

’ Fewer mundane tasks
No-code tools like Zapier make it super easy for anyone to automate the repetitive stuff, like managing pipelines or updating CRM notes.


""But aren't these tools expensive?""

Yes, there's a cost to equipping your team with these tools.


But what's the cost of not doing it?

Ineffective outreach that loses potential clients.

Sales reps are stuck doing research instead of closing deals.

Losing out to competitors with quicker, more efficient processes.

Its a decision every sales leader will need to consider soon...

urn:li:activity:7193874811901624320,"Why my start-up before my agency failed, even though it looked really promising:


It just looked promising to me.

A very good friend of mine and I always tried some side hustles together to build our own company.

We have been experimenting and generating images with MidJourney for a while and have gotten really good in prompt engineering.

Combine this with some experience in building Shopify stores and no starting capital.

Et voila - our own Print-On-Demand store for posters was founded ( 


Even though I really liked our prints and pictures and thought it would be a great product-market fit to target these with TikTok Ads - we've just made 4 sales.

I'm not sure if we just gave up too soon or priced it wrong - however, it still was a valuable lesson for me.

And the poster right next to my desk always reminds me of it.
(haven't hung it up yet, since I recently moved and got lost in other work =)


The lesson to learn from this in my opinion is to always try out your ideas and don't be afraid to fail, but also don't just assume that if you like something the market is willing to buy it.

If you wanna adapt this for your outbound campaigns:

Try out a lot of different angles and ideas, sometimes the least promising ones get the best results and the most creative and promising campaigns fail.


How do you like my poster, would you have bought it?

... at least if you don't get the fundamentals right - your technical setup aka your deliverability!

It's your key to unlocking the full potential of your cold outreach campaigns.


I've seen many focus on crafting the perfect cold email, yet they wonder why their open rates are low.

They follow best practices but overlook critical elements that can land them in spam.


Heres how to correct that behavior and turn your email deliverability into a robust engine for replies:

1ã Infrastructure Setup:

Invest time in configuring your infrastructure correctly. 
Make sure SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and domain redirect setups are done right. 
Just go onto GoDaddy, buy a new domain and a few Outlook mailboxes for example, and get the DNS settings right. Then send them into minimum 2 weeks of warmup at for example Smartlead or Instantly.ai.

=¨ PS: Please DON'T use your primary domain to send cold outreach campaigns!


2ã IP Address Rotation:

Dont just rely on a single IP. Rotate your IP addresses for better delivery. 
Doing this keeps your domain health and open rates high. Its not just about avoiding blacklists; it's about maintaining a positive sender reputation.


3ã Monitor Sender Reputation:

Keep a close eye on your sender metrics. Watch for spam complaints, unsubscribes, and bounce rates. This immediate feedback helps you identify and identify issues early. Remember, your sender reputation is always on the line.


4ã Continuous A/B Testing & Spintaxing:

Never stop testing and adapting. Randomizing your content helps you avoid spam filters while still sending huge amount of emails. Combine this with A/B testing various subject lines to see what works best and double down on that.


Crafting relevant emails is crucial, but without prioritizing deliverability, your messages won't reach their intended inboxes.

How do you optimize your cold email deliverability and ensure open rates of at least 70%?

False. =« 


Here's how to do efficient lead enrichment, with:

 Waterfall data provider checks
 No need for multiple API connections
 Single subscription sufficiency
 Built-in email validation

That's the way to resolve email-finding issues.

It simplifies processes. Saves subscription costs. Boosts lead quality.


The perfect example for this is the pre-built waterfall for finding work e-mails in Clay

It simply does the following:
- Check for email at data provider 1
- Not found -> check data provider 2
- Not found -> check data provider 3
...and so on.


There are plenty of options to choose from, like Icypeas, Prospeo, Datagma, Findymail, and Hunter.io.

You can rearrange priority and choose which providers to try in your waterfall.


On top of that, you can add an e-mail verification tool like ZeroBounce or DeBounce to verify that the found e-mail is correct - so the waterfall only stops if the e-mail is safe to send.

urn:li:ugcPost:7190018245712642048,"How to get rid of excel sheets to track leads.

It's crazy but still very common.

Businesses, especially smaller ones, operating from an excel sheet or a Trello Board, yet still managing to generate revenue.

(Imagine how much more they could achieve with the right tools)

So I always ask about the time they dedicate to tracking leads, engagement, current deal stages, and follow-ups with prospects.


These are the most common responses:

¡Setting reminder appointments in my calendar
¡Setting an alarm on my phone (this one made me smile)
¡Randomly, whenever the thought occurs
¡Not at all


So, what is the actual cost of not having a CRM?

LLow customer retention
LLosing potential deals
LLonger sales cycles
LMissing data


If you don't have a CRM yet or are considering a new one, here are my recommendations:

1ã Pipedrive 
A classic sales CRM with a straightforward kanban pipeline view. It features an integrated lead finder that allows you to build a pipeline directly inside the CRM. It also offers many useful integrations to enhance your CRM from their Marketplace.

2ã HubSpot 
An evergreen CRM that most are familiar with. The cool thing is its versatility and scalability to suit your needs. It has several tiers for sales, marketing, and customer support, making it quite modular and beginner-friendly.

3ã Breakcold 
If you heavily rely on LinkedIn outreach and struggle to keep track of engagements this is a great CRM for you. Breakcold does this for you, allowing you to engage with prospects directly from their user-friendly interface.

4ã Recruit CRM 
A great CRM for recruitment businesses. It combines an ATS with many useful CRM functions to build a straightforward and efficient candidate journey.

5ã folk 
Folk combines an innovative interface reminiscent of AirTable with the power of a CRM. It also allows you to enrich contact data directly inside their CRM. A really interesting approach and great for smaller, tech-savvy businesses.


I have tried all of them, some more extensively than others, but I can recommend each one.

Here's the trick =G 


What sounds like a dream for everyone doing this manual.

Is the reality with Clay.

It enables you to connect 50+ data providers.

So plenty of options to choose from.

If you include all scraping options and the possibility to connect with other providers via HTTP API it gets even more.



So how exactly does this work automated on scale:

1ã Find your data source

These are just 3 examples, which are basic but most of the time get the job done:

LinkedIn:
Most up-to-date B2B contact and company database.

Apollo.io:
Large and relatively cheap data provider with good insights and a native integration in Clay. (you need your own Apollo account though)

Claygent:
The AI agent can be used to scrape the company website and summarize their mission or perform Google searches. A detailed post on this will follow in the future!


2ã Define your structure

Large language models (LLM) like OpenAI work best when giving them a detailed prompt with guidelines on how to answer.

So think about the structure or a prefix you wanna use in your personalized outbound snippet.

Then fill in your data source as a variable to use as input when crafting the personalization.

""As I assume you are targeting {ICP}""


3ã Enjoy ( 

Now you can start the run and enjoy the hours of saved manual work be done in just minutes while keeping your quality high and sounding human-like.


=¡ Tip:
We always include an additional check to verify that the prefix/structure was used to ensure good quality and filter out if the AI hallucinated.


PS:
I attached a GIF, so you can get a glimpse of your dream coming true =	 

In this, we used the company description and their website to identify their target buyer persona


What is something you would wanna see automated to save you some manual work?

CRM Accuracy:

Let's say I'm working for Shovels and looking to tell a bunch of local contractors and service businesses that they need to use our data or they're going to get demolished by someone else who is....

First I'd consider how these local businesses get their customers; things like BNI Global groups, realtors, and other local-market economy stuff

Their growth motions are often less predictable than someone with a traditional SDR motion, which means the value of the next incremental deal is higher

And when that next deal is tied to a $40K HVAC install, or a 6-month generator backlog, being early isnt just helpful - its existential.

These businesses dont need a hundred leads. They need five right ones before anyone else sees them.

So the pitch changes. Its not heres a new list tool, its: we show you where money is about to show up in your zip code.

So we use Shovels data for Shovels' GTM

We pull contractors by ZIP � find the top performer in each trade � then use permit data to write Clay emails that hit their competitors right in the urgency.

Might be the one Im proudest to have sourced.

Heres why:

They told us up front they would never hire a typical cold email agency. But they had heard we worked differently.

Most cold email plays are a slop fest. Spin up domains, blast 100,000 emails, pray for scraps. Galaxies away from the professional sales motion most teams actually want.

This client wanted something more deliberate.

Seed stage. No paying customers. Two pilots that didnt reflect their future ICP. Founder-led sales and investor intros felt like false positives. They wanted to see if real, repeatable demand could be created with no bias, no halo, no shortcuts.

Could a cold email from a made-up persona, in a clean room environment, convert to real dollars?

Thats the test that scales. The one that justifies hiring and unlocks the next chapter.

So we got to work. Quietly testing. Building hypotheses. Searching for signal.

First came a steady flow of qualified opportunities.

Now a real deal. Cold-sourced. No tricks. Just validation that the long road was worth it.

The bigger point?

Not all situations call for the same playbook.

Most agencies focus on systematizing what they do. We focus on what you need. Strategy, not scripts. Unlocks, not checklists.

urn:li:ugcPost:7323372048666275841,"More teams are leaning on intent signals - site visits, product usage, search terms - to get smarter with outbound.

And sure, it works.

But signals are reactive. Theyre limited. And even when the signal points to your company, people are tired of being hounded the second they click a page or leave a comment.

Its become expected - and easy to ignore.

Intent shouldnt be the foundation of your GTM.

Its a boost. Not a strategy. The real opportunity is going deeper:

1) Break your market into real segments

2) Understand the personas inside each

3) Craft angles that speak to how they think, work, and buy

Thats how you build messaging that cuts through - with or without a signal.

Thats how you get to true message-market fit. (Aka speaking to your market in ways that are familiar, resonant and compelling)

We use Smartlead to map campaigns around one segment and one angle at a time. Generally 3-5x as many campaigns at a time as people are used to.

That way, we dont just know whats working - we know why.

A call where theyre happy to learn something happens because they believe you understand something about them & may have useful information to share on the other side

This applies to 40-70% of the market's current state of (or lack thereof) ""demand"", and there's very few people competing for this since it is chronologically further from ""closed won"" revenue

Failing outbound teams and high churn cold email agencies scrape by chasing the top 3%

1) Having directionality: a real point of view

Sometimes you read a cold email and by the end, you cannot even remember what it said.

You tune it out because there is no sting. No edge. No signal.

If your message is just more hay, even the needle gets lost.

You need something sharp enough to pull attention toward it.

2) Not being too confident: the =� =. Will Allred uncertainty heuristic

The better you get at showing uncertainty without losing your stance, the stronger your point of view lands.

If you communicate that you might be off and invite correction, you trigger responsiveness instead of resistance.

It is not about getting the guess right. It is about showing you thought carefully enough that a conversation feels worthwhile.

Replies do not come from perfection. They come from the combination of sharp insight and openness.

The Greeks called it logos, pathos, and ethos.

I call it logic, emotion, and presence.

Most messaging leans too heavily on logos. What we do. What we offer. What we think makes us different.

But only 10% of what people take in comes from the words themselves.

30% is pathos, the tone and feeling we carry.

And 60% is ethos, who we are when we say it and whether people believe us.

Thats why real messaging doesnt start with the what.

It starts with the reason. The tension. The thing underneath the thing.

The fear people wont say out loud, but feel every day.

The video below is a window into my ethos.

Its why The Deal Lab exists.

Because chasing anything that matters takes clarity, guts, and a whole lot of heart.

And if youre wondering how this ties into go-to-market work

Example 1

Before:  We help startups accelerate outbound with AI-driven targeting and copywriting.

Objection: We already have someone doing outbound (or weve tried and failed before).

Reframe: You probably already have outbound running - or tried it and it flopped. We only work with teams whove been burned before and still believe theres a better way.

Reframe: Most teams already track churn with health scores. The problem? They dont tell you why or what to do next. Thats where we come in.

The only thing changing how a prospect replies is the words you use // phrasing of your message

Sometimes I see people put a ton of work into crazy data scrapes, they enrich and segment a bunch of stuff, and then the actual words they use are mid (at best)

Copy should stand out; feeling & looking & MEANING uniquely = winning combo

The meaning part is critical; good segmentation and writing changes the literal meaning of your argument

Dont try to hack how something looks // the wrapper (I.e. mean the same thing using new words)

Its way better to ACTUALLY have a pattern-interrupt, unique, potent thing to say because you didnt work

1 to 1 messaging is kinda cope too because unless your product is designed 1 to 1, your customer actually benefits MORE from broad use cases

(If youre a niche user of a product youve probably see features devolve away from your use case an example)

Imagine thinking Netflix should do more pErSoNaLiZaTiOn >#>#># bruh come on

You use 1 to 1 when you dont understand the market well enough to make broader marketing messages

A random SDR is NOT a better message writer than Andy McCotter-Bicknell >f as an example - product marketing isnt an entry level skillset really

Oscillating between unscalable 1 to 1 messaging to your top 10-20% of TAM via founder, reps, whatever is cool to string some deals together

Scraping in demand tam via scaled campaigns w basic 101 messaging is ok I guess too (not my cup of tea)

Winning companies are built on what The Deal Lab does; intelligently broken down markets with unique messaging based on competitive advantage

Heres 8 micro lessons I paid for in blood, sweat and tears

1) have a purpose. Any worthwhile path will be trying, and your purpose makes those pains worth it

2) serve your customers. None of this exists without them. Theyre not an obstacle or a hurdle or anything else negative.

3) lead with bravery. Doing what is right and what is most self serving are not the same. The most fulfilling path is based on whats right.

4) you cant do it all. Ive tried. You need to design systems that do things for you and hire talented people to operate them

5) give first. Value flows freely when trust is established, and if youre great at what you do people wont be in a hurry to get rid of you once they have a sample.

6) good ideas with no execution do nothing for you. Execution is rarely limited by good ideas. Dont cope with thinking for what doing could resolve

7) you gain more by removing blockers than adding additional good things. Whether in copy, operations, or anything else - via negativa 

8) have fun. Time flies, the wins you wanted dont taste as sweet as you sold yourself, and the things youll look back on with love arent the same as what youd expect while youre in it

1) start with a wide tam list

I use Ocean.io for this 70% of the time, and Serper scrapes of googles maps the other 30%

You go intentionally wide

With ocean thats still pretty narrow, but the idea being take an account list that is inclusive of all target accounts and likely has some extra less good fit ones too

This way you miss none

2) narrow this down using basic, but unique, criteria

List and message are tightly tied together

What you know is what you can say

If I target smb maybe I can segment by how long theyve gotten consistent reviews (as a proxy for whether theyve been running well vs are intermittently excellent)

Thats a random idea - but its unique and starts to form a story that will be unalike the one you can say when you only use basic data (the same stuff everyone else uses)

Appending the tam data w fields that help you segment or message uniquely is a huge asymetrical advantage right now 

3) define personas based on ceo of the problem framework from Justin Michael

Transcend title, focus on who is owning what

You need to speak to their top 1-2 priorities or you wont cut through the noise 

Creative framing is a superpower here

Not engineering 

Unique definition, unique story& all pattern interrupt & if you come with good acumen based arguments (not weird hacky stuff)

4) map your arguments // angles // whatever you call the stuff you say (sub unit of a persona in a segment of a market)

Define core jobs to be done

Theres a number of ways to go about writing

Josh Braun, Will Allread, Jed Mahrle& all put out great frameworks to work off of

I always make sure Im doing unique, off beat stuff - but you need to frame it off a basis of regular good stuff - they all write about both :)

5) run campaigns, iterate (same idea over and over w new ways of framing + adjacent ideas close to core one), qualify / disqualify ideas 

If you do new ideas all over the place - you dont really make traction 

Commit to digging into a few ways of framing your angles, not just one - creativity can help land ideas that seem to be losers

As you run these, consider how going back to new segmentation methods and unique data (tam specific - unlocks new ways to speak to the market)

It sounds rational. But it flattens the value of the work.

When everyone solves the same problem the same way, you stop being differentiated.

You become replaceable.

Utility keeps you in the game.

Art helps you win it.

Art isnt fluff - its functional.

It attracts attention, builds memory, earns loyalty.

Its how we connect with people (decision makers, users, channel partners), not just systems.

It gives shape to identity, turns transactions into experiences, and helps teams care.

The gap between today and tomorrow isnt just capability.

Its belief.

And belief spreads through story, design, and expression - not specs.

Thats why the best work isnt just engineered.

Product market fit generally = when someone will pay you for what you sell to fix a problem when they know they have that problem and that your solution exists

Message market fit is what you can say to an audience go get them excited to come talk to you

In an ideal world theyre the same I.e. you can just go hey I have some salesforce crm and people are jumping at the chance to learn more

More often, your brand isnt compelling on its own & no one knows you

This is actually a hidden advantage

You ONLY get to win off competitive reasoning - aka only the ideas you share // transfer will compel your market

Its an advantage also to separate why people buy vs why they talk to you; theres usually up funnel discussions that have to happen before demand for what you do exists

Being the catalyst of those convos, injecting ideation into the scene EARLIER than your competitors gives you an advantage

Some messaging chases transactional hacks to get someone to take a call

Imo ideal messaging fosters intrigue, which creates an opportunity to sell vision & then strategy to hit that vision and then the tactical Xs and Os to carry out that strategy& 

If you can define a more granular audience, and speak to the nuanced needs of the people in that audience, its a strong start towards message market fit

urn:li:activity:7307183362454999040,"The value of a meeting set via a founder doing 1:1 email and the meeting set via a rep are NOT THE SAME (heres why)

Start with why someone says yes

They perceive a gain be possible from spending their time

So when a founder writes a message, this is coming FROM a decision maker

Someone with more credibility, more track record, and more selfish reasons outside of wow I think your product is sick to say sure lets do a zoom

Aka its way way way easier from a founder

Same for why LinkedIn works so well for cold outbound; instant credibility built in

Theres a problem though

It isnt scalable // repeatable - it doesnt represent what a rep will be able to recreate

You see this constantly

Founder gets meetings, hires rep to take it on, everything falls apart

What happened?

It ends up - the compelling reason people had been saying yes WASNT the actual product or service you sell!

This happens all the time - and people misjudge the situation because they dont realize founder set meetings =\= rep set meetings

ONE of the values of doing cold email is to test & validate cold messaging at some scale (100s to 100,000s depending on use case) and to dial that in OUTSIDE the context of what works for the founder

(quick n dirty setup that BANGS is Smartlead to send, ScaledMail inboxes, Ocean.io for company data, LeadMagic for contact data + validation)

Having the asset of knowing what messaging works, outside of leveraging founder or VP brands to send from, is immensely valuable for companies

Theres ways to hack sh*t to set more meetings; that is different than iterating messaging against personas to figure out what they care most about and are willing to act off of

urn:li:activity:7307092284091613187,"Occams Razor Campaigns are what I call the early outbound sequences that we (generally) run for clients.

They strip outbound sequences down to their most essential components, testing the simplest, most direct approach first before layering on complexity. The structure is intentionally basic:

	1.	We saw you X  Clearly state why they are being targeted. This is the foundation of relevance.

	2.	Weve helped others Y  Establish credibility with a straightforward, proof-driven statement.

	3.	Would you like to Z?  A direct call to action, eliminating ambiguity and friction.

This approach mirrors the scientific method in outbound: we start with a clear, testable hypothesis - if we communicate relevance, credibility, and a clear next step in the simplest possible way, will it drive responses? 

By running these sequences, we collect baseline data on what works before introducing more nuanced messaging or personalization.

More importantly, this method serves to nullify hypotheses efficiently.

If a broad, logical, and structured outreach approach fails to generate engagement, it suggests that the core assumptions about targeting, messaging, or value proposition need refinement before investing in more intricate or resource-heavy campaigns.

If it does work, then we have validation that were moving in the right direction, and we can begin layering in more sophisticated messaging, variables, and personalization.

Its BETTER & a good signal if you can drive meetings off of something simpler like this vs some crazy coordination of events (that often forces your actual acquireable market down into tiny #s because only a small % of the market will have a number of aligned signals at once)

Naive, small thinking

In b2b GTM, growth plays do not compete - they complement / stack

Things that work become asymmetrical in outcome; and it is worth continuing to fund

Thats why Google ads gets such a huge % of marketing budgets - known throughput - even if CAC is high, predictability > volatility

The services space, agencies, brings experience in how to orient against certain problems and/or has advantages to solving them with you

Example: you have 20 BDRs and theyre doing good work

Bdr leader wants the benefit of Clay, org agrees&

Taking the time to learn and implement MAY be useful if the value of internal expertise outweighs the immediate opportunity to run the play with people who dont need the learning curve

Imo both should exist

I dont think its ideal for companies to be purely reliant on external vendors forever to operate their stuff

But I also think if all the value you get from a vendor is doing the thing, then its a weak relationship relative to ones where theres stronger mutual stakes & gains

The goal of healthy companies is not to minimize expenditures and limit the amount of people participating in their success

The healthiest companies create opportunity to invest in ideas & experiments that provide more opportunities to hit that asymmetrical win we all want

AUTOMATE is a scary word for many

Here, we take a humanist approach by giving the best of the best accounts to reps, automating their research (on a weekly basis), and free them up to do what they do best

Argue with strangers on social med.... I mean sell things =	 

Tier A accounts = top 10-20%ish of your TAM

These are the best, most valuable accounts to engage, so we like to separate them and tee them up for sellers/founders to engage with directly

To make this easy, we send a weekly update (powered by Clay, Perplexity, OpenAI, and LinkedIn) that covers whatever random things you'd like (posting patterns, headcount trajectory, basically anything you can dream of)

This is built to send slack updates because presumably these accounts are already in salesforce or hubspot - but the possibilities are endless

Tier B accounts get auto-sequenced via Smartlead (data by LeadMagic, Prospeo.io, Icypeas, and Erol Toker's new product that you def should be checking out)

We use rulesets to only send to 1/3 of this slice of the market per month; aka all of it per quarter.

FEW companies touch their TAM 1x per quarter even, and if they did they'd be a lot better off for it

Tier C accounts are left to rot!

Clay will revisit them for me quarterly, check if they've ascended to the status of ""worthy for my attention"" (jokes), and send them to Tier B list if they meet the criteria.

urn:li:activity:7305119113276755968,"Tomorrow I'm sharing a video on how you can use Clay's ""Scheduled Columns"" to run an automated TAM scoring & prioritization engine

The gist is that I'll take a random market, and break it into 3 chunks

A-Tier Accounts (Top 15ish% of the TAM) will get a weekly refresh of a bunch of signals and research prompts.

Typically I would distribute these accounts among reps, feed them the signals in real-time, and let the reps engage.

Since there will be eyeballs here constantly, we refresh weekly to be on top of anything important FAST.

We only let accounts where we have full contact data to go here, so the team's time is spent 100% on ideal-fit accounts with great data availability (aka give your best players the best hands to play).

B-Tier Accounts (The next 30%ish of the TAM) will get researched, contacts harvested, and enrolled into Smartlead campaigns

These accounts are good enough to engage, but are deprioritized either due to imperfect fit or lack of contact data.

We can run these for you completely, or build you the system to run it together (we're faster than you, but sometimes you need the real-time visibility).

The B tier can be revisited monthly to see if they've ascended to A-tier, fallen to C-tier, or if we can find new contacts // events to trigger outreach.

We also sometimes break these into thirds and cycle them quarterly vs monthly (depends team size, tam size, market fit, and all that jazz)

C-Tier accounts get ignored for now, and revisited monthly/quarterly/bi-annually to re-run and see if they've ascended to better fit status.

Table 1 is your whole TAM, and used to tag as Tier A/B/C

Table 2 is Tier A and runs weekly, fed to your team // salesforce, so they have up to date intel on ideal-fit accounts (this table helps teams hit quota)

Table 3 is Tier B and runs monthly/quarterly, researches/enriches/validates contacts, and feeds them directly to automated email or email + social campaigns (this table is for your cold email expert - shameless plug The Deal Lab if you want me running this for you, we're hella good at it)

Table 4 is Tier C and runs quarterly/bi-annually to possibly send accounts up into the B-tier list and otherwise index-but-keep-away the accounts that you don't need to bother with.

This can real-time map back to CRM to make it a source of truth, or we can send to Salesloft / Outreach, or we can do other cool stuff.

Its been unreal seeing what sorts of companies adopt Smartlead as an example; when they announced their first 25 experts (somewhat pilots of this among the agency space) - it became big buzz

My business grew noticeably from it

Vaibhav Namburi helped feed my family in a way that Id never experienced before

Ill never be able to repay Jesse Ouellette for being an early advocate to us in the same way

Fast forward, and the Clay ecosystem that Bruno Estrella has spearheaded has done this on another level - broadening the impact from outbound centric to GTM as a whole

He told me when he first joined about their thinking on the heels of Webflow building a partner ecosystem with strong flywheel effects

The ethos is beautiful; tech enables cool stuff, customers buy tech, customers get best outcomes by working with services market who knows the tech best

Flywheel

Everyone wins

When revenue plays work, it creates excess funds for future good things

1) if you pay people to cold call, you should be using TitanX

They guarantee 20-30% pickup rates when calling against data scored by them

Its extremely asymmetrical

2) the data you want isnt in an existing platform, its in your head (and call recordings!)

Apollo and zoominfo index companies by standardized fields based on what helps them (the data company) manage & index data

Your prospects dont see themselves as average; they know theres nuance to their market, company, and own situation

In order to map your market effectively, you need to use something like Clay to append company data with the fields that helps you communicate differently to your market than everyone else who pulled the same list

3) if you dont have internal expertise on outbound / technical gtm stuff, but want the outcomes from it, hire!

Internal or consultants - youll go farther, faster if you hire vs DIY

urn:li:activity:7302588305177464833,"Heres an Ugly, messy, effective way to make a pretty decent list in Clay that beats the brakes off of what you can do inside legacy data tools

The bar isnt that high anyways

If you wanted a list of material handling wholesalers or video game developers (mobile/desktop/console/handheld) eith multiplayer games between 18 months pre launch and 60 months post launch - you could never get this from Apollo or zoominfo effectively

89% of the time, reps will pull a list like construction equipment in their state & let it fly (97% of companies would be poor fit)

Or video game developers and same thing, 77% of companies would be disqualify-tier fits based on known, obvious facts

People stuck in pre gpt era think reps should comb through this stuff

This fails because people get lazy, and dividing the tam BEFORE filtering is a great way to end up with a mess of an understanding of how big your market is

Its way better to do this instead:

1) pull large, overly inclusive lists out of legacy tools that dont actually support you in making targeted opinionated lists

2) load into clay - youre going to get 200x your moneys worth so dont worry about credit costs (dont auto run)

3) plug in your gpt api key; clay credits may be 1.5 cents per call where agp 4o mini api is like 1/100th of a penny per call (insanely cheap)

4) go hog wild running claygent enrichments for every single little qualifier youd wanna know to help you build a tight account list

5) filter out the bad fits, spend more time on these great fits, and go cancel your old data contract to double your clay usage 

The legacy tools are much better at harvesting contacts out of companies - but for company search the S-tier combo is Ocean.io + Clay 

In ML measurement terms theyre like recall (max capture of good fit things) and precision (low inaccuracy rate of the things captured)

urn:li:activity:7302341289700667393,"Three times last week I got asked a question about how the name pops up in the from part of an email

All three times, someone was showing me a bad cold email they got

Usually it means your DNS records arent properly setup, but no one really knows why&. UNTIL NOW ;)

DKIM:
    * Adds a digital signature to emails, allowing receiving servers to verify the email originated from the claimed domain.�(
    * Uses a pair of cryptographic keys (public and private) where the public key is stored in a DNS record.�(
    * Helps prevent email tampering during transmission.�(
SPF:
    * Lists the IP addresses authorized to send emails for a domain, enabling recipient servers to check if the sending server is legitimate.�(
    * Stored as a TXT record in DNS, specifying which servers are allowed to send emails on behalf of a domain.�(
    * Primarily focuses on preventing email spoofing.�(

How they work together:

* When an email is received, the recipient server looks up the SPF record in the sender's DNS to check if the sending server is authorized.�(
* If the SPF check passes, the server then verifies the DKIM signature in the email header to ensure the email content hasn't been tampered with. 

BOOM

Youre practically a DNS record expert now, and know more than 87% of people charging $$$$ to send cold emails for people.

Now when a company asks me to how to fix this (without becoming a client) I tell them they either need to learn to do the above or work with a solution like Maildoso who provides a SaaS-like experience (log in to a software and do everything).

The DIY method is good for people with technical skills or if their time cant be spent more valuably elsewhere - for most its best to invest and move faster

Heres how to build it fast:

But first a science less (The Deal Lab is a lab after all!)

Humans are wired to survive, not thrive; meaning our instincts are tied more closely to self preservation / threat mitigation than they are towards actualization.

The stoic phrase via negativa (addition by subtraction) applies here as well - meaning we can gain trust / advance our mission by removing something

What is that something?

Uncertainty! Fear. Concern. Worry. Doubt. Hesitation.

Everything that would get in the way of sprinting at yes

What Im getting at is that by being extremely forward with someone and calling out their fears up front - you can dispel them and create an environment where open dialogue occurs much more easily

In your agenda at the beginning of a call, letting them know

Hey <person> on these calls, people come to me with all sorts of cool ideas of things theyre hoping to accomplish.

some small % of the time, that leads to me unapologetically recommending they work with my business and Ill explain why if thats the case

Most of the time, I end up pointing you to a friend or someone I know who is better suited to serve your needs.

Either way, my #1 goal is you walk away with a plan youre excited about, clarity to make a decision, and a positive enough experience w me that youre willing to point others to me in the future.

That work for you?

People think the magic is in ""look alike searches"" aka Ocean's ability to take a company URL and find similar companies

(Which is actually sick)

But I believe there's a better application; a few extra steps and you get cleaner lists

Let's say you want commercial glass wholesalers who are neither retail nor manufacturers of glass.

What I'll do is jump onto google and go find a business that are the type of business I am looking for

I will use the look alike feature to find ~10 more similar businesses

I will then expand the cards for the companies we find and look at what ""tags"" are being used for these companies

I will mirror these tags and build a search of a bunch of ""include any of"" for Tags, Industries, Headcount, Revenue, and whatever else is useful

Then I remove the ""look alike"" filter

This usually widens the search a little bit - but if I have applied my additional criteria well - I am left with a great list

urn:li:activity:7291896603789926400,"You think you need a Clay person; too vague, destined to fail, heres some better ways to think about it

1) you need a gtm strategist

You have execution/level people, and leadership in place that coordinates & aligns w top brass.

Whats missing is someone to come in & creatively segment your market - come up with how each segment will be approached - and basically operationalize the concepts that the VPs+ come up with

These people will fail hiring someone too basic w their approach; though technical competency is required to really think through how this can best be approached

2) you need a gtm data-operations person

Sometimes your company knows exactly what plays it wants to run already.

But youre less familiar w how to actually execute - or it takes too long // is too manual currently

So you hire a clay operator who can build systems for you & let your team do its thing

In this situation, it is more tactical & theres a clearer binary on can this person execute what Im telling them?

3) you need a cold email specialist

This is a small fraction of clays impact

If your real focus is can I send cold emails that drive opportunity & deals? Then Id be direct w that and go straight for people who do this vs broader clay programs

More and more Im seeing clay operators who dont want to do outbound, which is reasonable due to its difficulty and relative transactional nature as a service to provide 

If you need this - find someone who is great at it

4) you just need a clay generalist

You actually may really need this!

Im not hating on people thinking this way, I just tend to think theres risk in addressing a problem that hasnt been defined that well

So far Im batting 1000 re: convos w companies hiring internal clay / gtm engineer operators and shifting how they think about what they actually need 

But I bet theres times everything above is solved for and they just need a tool operator basically

urn:li:activity:7289864501049397248,"There's a major sin of cold emailing that many companies unknowingly commit

Sending from their primary domain

Domain health is a confusing, nebulous and unapproachable topic - so here's some intel.

Domains themselves have a ""reputation rating""

If you send to invalid emails, or get marked as spam often, this causes a hit on this reputation

Normal sending and receiving creates as a positive reputation

The smaller the company, newer their domain is, and less volume of ""good"" emails they send - the easier it is to get your domain flagged

The solution is to send off an alt domain such as ""TheDealLabGTM.com"" vs ""TheDealLab.com""

Inboxes also have reputations, so you need to manage the volume that you send from or the provider may flag you // shut yours down

On top of the above, you need to setup DNS, SPF, and DKIM records or your messages are more likely to be blocked

It's BRUTAL when I walk into a prospect's company and find out they have a bunch of people sending emails, no replies ever, not even hitting inbox, just complete waste of time

I think the future of outbound = MOST companies working with external resources paired with internal ones

Example: before you'd have to mess with all of the email stuff above, but now non technical teams // people who aren't willing to mess w DNS records can use tools like Maildoso and skip to sending

Healthy inbox (aka that actually deliver) + good data = your ONLY shot at even testing whether or not your messaging is even hitting when sending cold emails

Since then, brands like Apex Revenue, Growth Engine X, RB2B (I think), etc have all adopted this phrasing as standard

It shares a qualitative frame on how to dial in messaging and think much more deeply about your target audience.

In the age of GPT, you should just throw the text in + your messaging and ask for feedback.

Scans the backend of a companys website to identify visible tech. Its quick and accessible but limitedmany internal tools wont leave a trace in public-facing code.

2� Mining Job Postings:

Job descriptions often reveal tools mentioned in hiring requirements, like Salesforce or HubSpot. While creative, this method is manual, time-consuming, and incomplete.

3� Data Aggregation (HG Insights):

This is where HG Insights stands apart. It combines data from multiple sources to uncover both public-facing and internal tools, offering hyper-granular control. From NAICS/SIC codes to specific tech stacks, the depth here is unmatched.

With this new integration, Clay brings this power directly into your workflowno expensive subscription needed.

The more you understand them, and can speak to exactly why their situation feels frustrating& the more likely they are to work with you

1. Using Ocean.io to build look-alikes off inbound Calendly bookings, Prospeo.io to grab the emails of the similar contacts, then Anthropic to create messages citing the similarities and asking if they'd like to talk too.

2. Using Clay's Webhook feature to receive data from Make, that pulls 25 contacts off a dynamic HubSpot list every 7 minutes and sends them to Clay to enrich (self-cleansing CRM I make that will auto-add emails, linkedin profile, phone, whatever else to ANY contact added to the CRM with zero lift from your team).

3. Using Serper to find 310,000+ police offices / departments, pulling city planning documents, analyzing crime rates, and making hyper-custom & well researched arguments to police chiefs re: how we can help them make their city safer (have to anonymize the client so being vague).

4. Sourcing companies with Sales Dev leaders, checking if they're on salesforce, and sending them to the most well known cold call guy so he can grow his business ;)

The #1 issue I see with potential clay users / buyers (talking companies, not reps here) is that they lack the ability to think through how the tool works & what exactly it can do for them.

Clay is easy enough to DIY, but successful B2b revenue teams will get the best and fastest results working with external experts to get the most out of the tool.

There's 1,000s that can copycat known workflows - maybe 10s that can net-new create high-impact ones custom to your business.

The skillset is like GTM Product Manager - aligning the space between revops (technical, lacks sales dev artistic lens oftentimes) and sales dev (workhorses, but can lack nuance / technical acumen).

If you're the curious type, I run a FREE community for GTM operators / clay users called ""Clay Cafe"" with a signup link tied to my ""featured"" section - Fridays 10am pacific we do a group zoom call.

2. Target market summary

This is about the COMPANY TYPES in this market, not specific to the target you have. Broad strokes here - how do you serve this market segment uniquely?

3. Target account summary

What unique factors of this account, in the context of the segment they exist in, are unique?

Think through the lens of what does this board care about // think is required to make them successful versus every other thing they could do?

Directionality is good here too - avoid static data that is ALREADY STALE (aka the stuff if major db tools)

4. Target persona summary 

Not the unique 1 person, but the general bucket they fit into& what is true of it? Metrics? Team size? Goals? Personality type? Everything 

5. Target contact summary

Now research the person aka what is their career story, how do they present themselves, what are they proud of, what are they likely trying to achieve, what extracurriculars do they engage in, aka everything that makes them a human vs the avatar of the persona

Identity is important, because it is the baseline of how people operate + the ""default"" programming our mind runs passively in the background

Our subconscious mind exists as an energy preservation mechanism; if we had to cognitively focus on and decide on every single thing we do - our heads would explode like the aliens in Mars Attacks when you play classical music to them

The idea here is instead of overcoming the objection of disinterst that I had shared, they're labeling my stance

Issue is that it's dishonest a bit; to pretend not wanting to talk to a tax strategy sales guy = having everything in order is silly

Reality is there's 50 bajillion things I could/should/need to do rn to make my life better and skirting taxation is low on my list.

A better approach would have been ""Got it. Guessing you either don't actually  care to maximize tax strategy or have your ducks in a row already. Am I off base?

If it's the former, lmk if you're open to me inviting you to a webinar in the future or sending you some of my posts.""

THAT is being a solution seller. THAT is helping your market.

It's easy to tell this person doesn't care about me, and that's why even if I needed this, the message would turn me off a bit.

Sellers often make the object of their focus their solution or the general problems it solves for; I literally dont care about either of those

You INCREASE resonance by aligning your offering to the single, ONE, UNIQUE prospects' needs.

Many are only capable of doing this writing 1 to 1 emails because theyre a lot worse at pattern recognition that someone who can write one email that resonates with 1000s of target buyers

Use 1 to 1 when you're learning the market (make it narrow), and as you gain understanding work on scaling insights and expanding TAM

But first - the frame

As sellers and/or founders, we are placed in an inherent position to want more

Convos, meetings, opportunities, deals& all of it

A healthy drive for growth and winning is requisite in most cases

Where we go wrong is taking on an identity of lacking/being incomplete until that nth next deal comes through

We subconsciously plummet into a place of scarcity & and act transactional // flounder away opportunities

Desperation can come through; commission breath as they call it, though I think theres an energetic exchange happening much sooner than youre opening your actual mouth

People start using language to belittle the rest of the market

Theyre disorganized

Theyre not as creative

They automate everything

They suck

Whats CRAZY to me, is how WEAK these comments come off to YOUR BUSINESS

If you win because the competition sucks, it means you banking on prospects being stoked youre one increment above useless

Its aiming lower than people want to go

When you have something unique about what you do, positively framing what you DO is way better than negatively framing the rest of the market

When a prospect hears you do something cool and unique usually their first thought isnt can I NOT work with this guy and instead see how closely the competition can match it? 

Usually if you NAIL positioning and message market fit and run a good disco youll have proprietary demand 

Aka youll have etched a worldview into your prospects mind that makes it much harder for later people to come in and compete against

Keep the focus on what your prospects want to solve, what their companys can justify spend for, and ways you can address their needs

Use language like where most agencies are focused on volume & meeting count, we focus on granularity of market segmentation and potency of resonance - we will run smaller, more targeted and more custom campaigns to figure out what can work best for you

urn:li:activity:7269530142543089665,"Granulairty = potency = resonance = polarization

Healthy growth happens when you can polarize the market in your favor

If you think of resonance as being 1 part alignment and 1 part intensity, youll be on the right track

Alignment can be thought of as how tightly overlapped are the venn diagrams between what your target audience natively thinks/feels vs how in-group your target perceives your message feels.

Intensity is the emotional side, and how meaningful this idea is to your target in the context of everything else they could care about.

The amateur approach is to figure out how you can talk about what you do that makes people like you more

The issue with that is that its self centered; youre beginning with yourself as the center of the universe and lack empathy for your market

The savvier approach is START with the market.

What do they care about? Why? Whats challenging with that? What options do they have? How do they make decisions? Where do they read about industry news? Who do they trust? Who do they hate? What do their non-industry friends know about their job (aka what have they complained about at bbqs)?

Align yourself to the market as they see themselves, and watch your results increase

Next focus on poking the bear and figure out what ways you can provoke the market to engage related to the idea youre trying to align to.

Be radically honest here - call out the truths no one else is willing to own.

Use language that is somewhat jarring, but make sure to soften it to avoid being distracting

In the end, you want to put words to the frustrations and road blocks they may not have even been able to summarize so clearly before

(but you dont actually understand how they help so you do something weird and slightly off putting&)

Simply put, communication comes down to 2 core pillars: signal & palatability

Signal = your core message

For The Deal Lab, we will help you find deep resonance with your market aka message market fit and then exploit that resonance via modern day go-to-market systems which we can either operate on your behalf or build for you 

Thats the signal, thats relatively all encompassing to the various ways we support customers

Issue is that this can fall flat at face value (heh& face&) because it lacks context & is relatively patterned among plenty of other great operators out there

So enter&

Palatability = the seasonings to your core message that you use to give context and make it more appealing

Signals, triggers, personalization, etc& all that good stuff goes here

Its important and great operators can enhance tf out of a sales motion by making the messaging more palatable

Importantly though, focusing here before having distinct signal fit is a mistake!

Why?

Because hacking attention =\= improving business case

Imagine a world where you go tell your entire tam we do x and get zero positive engagement

One may think wow let me go do some crazy stuff I just saw to make this better

Id say dont

If you establish the signal : market fit sucks, increasing the incremental effort it takes to make it work better is like searching for Jesus in the bottom of a whisky bottle& 

Point being that not all ways of hacking attention or palatability will be helpful

You may be amplifying a bad signal

Or you may be doing what Erol Toker did in a previous org and (paraphrasing) do TOO GOOD at appealing to MEETING your market while and finding yourself having accidentally branded too strong of an impression of what you are into a market that doesnt want that thing and POOF business is dead (spam is not real, but saturation is&)

POTENCY is king

Find something that hits with the market at least somewhat at face value, and when you start hacking attention on top of it youll have hockey stick growth (allegedly - this is not financial advice)

Make sure your interrupts come with a strong serving of acumen / problem intimacy or you end up risking showing up to the zoom call with your wifes red light therapy mask on - confusing everyone - possibly scaring away prospects - all for some silly social media engagement ;)

The same process gets another client 3 a day (less than $100 per meeting& I love when we deliver for clients like this)

In both instances, we tried a more general approach in our first campaign together

I call these Occams razor campaigns because theyre testing & validating/invalidating the most basic we do x for y to our audience

I think these are great initial tests for 2 main reasons:

1. We fish out initial objections // get direct market feedback from the face value of our offer.

This is always useful; Wynter has a nice happy customer base helping companies get this feedback (and tons more)

2. We avoid having to backtrack.

If you start w something flashier and it doesnt work, you always end up going back to the basic stuff anyways& so good to run some % of total volume using these

So as we ran these Occams razor campaigns, we were mapping our some creative ideas to segment more granularly and go further

The idea being: how can we show up to our prospects citing information and talking to them from a foundational understanding that is 6x that of the average message they receive?

For one client it means identifying which police officers of departments inside of model c veils have an FAA license

For another it means finding emerging market product teams with high PM:L&D hire ratios & who have made acquisitions in the last 2 years inside of hyper-regulated industries

For another we look for manufacturers with tons of SKUs, who sell through channel programs, who use PowerPoint in their sales motions

And another we are looking at companies who laid off account managers/customer success, gave the renewal & upsell work to AEs, have a revops function, and are salesforce native

All of these are examples of relatively EASY datasets to build, that are not at all available inside of legacy data providers, and will help you win more / faster

Whether you plug this into cold callers, cold emailers, outbound LinkedIn, paid ads, outsourced help or any other form of go to market (aka the literal verb to take part in doing something and not standing around talking about it) - you will benefit massively

Another benefit is by clustering accounts earlier by deeper research, you eliminate a lot of task switching cost that occurs trying to bounce between types of prospects 

Advantages pop up if someone is calling on VPs of Matketing inside sales led growth orgs (specific) all day instead of b2b revenue leaders (general)

The copy, which everyone is always so excited to talk about, writes itself when your list is built based on what changes the argument you will make to a prospect for why theyd benefit from working with you

All of this is sound, timeless fundamentals that can now be delivered rapidly at scale for a fraction of the cost

If youre not familiar with these terms, what Im about to lay out will help you understand how to handle the unknown and build relative order in a chaotic world. 

Its a shift in mindset thats essential for anyone building systemswhether in business, personal growth, or decision-making.

When people think about building a system, they often focus on the things they can control and willfully ignore the uncontrollables. They treat systems as simple and predictable, assuming inputs directly determine outputs in a clean, linear way. The problem? Reality doesnt work like that. Irregularities creep in, outcomes deviate, and the system breaksnot because it was bad, but because it was pretending to be simpler than it really was.

Complex systems take a different approach. They recognize the black box of unknowable factorsthings you cant fully understand or control. Instead of trying to eliminate uncertainty, you embrace it. The focus shifts to controlling what you can: anchor to your inputs, measure your outputs, and iterate. You dont need to know exactly what happens in the middle. What matters is testing, adapting, and refining over time.

This approach doesnt mean you give up controlit means you stop over-assuming it. Complex systems arent about perfection; theyre about resilience. They thrive in the face of change because theyre built to learn and evolve.

With sales, GTM, startups& were often dealing with complex systems.

Say you send 100 emails

Today, youre blowing it if youre tracking opens (as in causing emails to not land in your targets inbox)

But when you used to be able to, 50-80%ish was considered ok (lower end being closer to real opens vs latter likely including faux-opens / not coming from someone reading the message)

Which means the max reply rate would be ~50%, since the other 50% didnt even land

Now lets say you exclude out of office from reply rate (as you should); that may account for 10% of that 100, so now total max reply rate is 45%

Next, most opened emails never even get read

Theyre skimmed or opened and quickly deleted, which causes 0 impression on a prospect re: brand & is NOT a sign that the messaging / positioning / content is bad

This is just behavioral and situational from them perceiving you to be low value based on the aggregate of what theyve experienced in email before

Imo this is likely 1/4-1/2 of anyone who opens your email

Which means your max reply rate may be closer to 22-30%ish

-

TLDR; 

1) non delivered emails dont hurt your brand and dont inundate your market, since no one saw them in the first place

2) many delivered and unanswered emails were not read and hardly even perceived, aka theyre not leaving a negative taste in your markets mouth

3) imo, qualitatively looking at replies to see if anyone is particular bothered by your outreach is a much better proxy for whether youre spamming anyone 

4) if each potential prospect in your market got 1-4 brief, quality emails per quarter (most teams dont cover tam well), youd certainly close more deals & this can be built easily

heres 5 timeless practices to sell more (without chasing fads)

1) pattern interrupt: uniqueness will never ever go out of style.

At all times, taking the current way of doing things and adding a mechanism of surprise will improve results

This requires unique, net new thinking - go learn to do this for yourself

2) give to receive: seek to provide value to the world around you, and it will be returned to you

Universal law of attraction

Whatever you seek in life, you will find by giving it away to others.

Focus on how hugely you can impact those around you instead of how to extract what you want from things

Works every time

3) througput / volume: if you currently touch 1/10th of the market per quarter, increasing that to 1/3 per quarter will 2-3x your results typically

This can be achieved by automation, outsourcing, training or hiring.

If youre technical, automate more

If you know exactly what someone needs to do to get repeatable results & unit economics work out, hire more

If you know how to do it better and have the time, train your people

If you dont know any of the above; working w a service business may be best

4) patience: long games win

It takes very little effort to be a top 10% rep / founder in terms of product / market knowledge

It does take time

If you skip that time, you risk building useless things or transactional running through relationships for short term gains that will f**k you long term

Play the long game, always

5) embrace eternal optimism: people dont need or want more negativity

No matter how bad things are, the best leaders are casting vision towards brighter futures

The world wants to be led; few take the reins to lead from a place of selflessness/holistic good 
 (selfish = scarce = negative imo) 

It is easy to be drawn to emotionally lash out from frustration, jealousy, and all sorts of other lousy feelings

It takes heroic discipline to remain positive and set an example for others

Sales has given me a life I wasnt destined for

Uniqueness is a pattern interrupt, a personalization mechanism, and a way to maximize deliverability

Clients are consistently seeing that taking the time to break down the market more granularly is driving much higher responses and positive engagement from the market

We're doing this with fully ai-written emails too (prompted by 10x the words, and with more acumen than your average BDR is capable of, keeping the messages themself well above average in terms of quality)

Below is a cold list, and the offer has no lead magnet or give-away; just strong resonance with the market

We'll do even better as we layer Trigify.io in, which we have started using now that Jordan Crawford killed his jobs data product <3 This is how we do things like source lead lists based on keywords from job descriptions as a proxy for how teams operate (helped a gifting platform identify who in their ICP has gifting motions w this stuff)

Some clients want comprehensive TAM mappings, others want daily targets for each seller queued up for them, and others just let us fill their calendars for them

He ran a small hifi shop in Oakland California that served high end residential clients

He was my inspiration to get into sales when he told me as a 5 year old theres only one job in the world where you choose how much you are going to make

So about a year and a half ago I left what I assumed may be my final w2 role ever

My mindset was I was going to make this idea I had work, no matter what

I knew validating outbound messaging would resonate with the market

So I go on this little run, land some clients, help them grow their companies&

Hire a few fine people

Things are good& better than ever (and at the tail end of an immeasurably challenging period getting things going)

Then a recruiter comes knocking

From {cant say, but yes that one}

A few interviews deep and theres a chance to pursue a role incredibly uniquely matched for my skills

Im stunned, and then the comp comes in and its multiples more than anything Ive seen

Through these talks, somehow i remain a choice candidate

But the issue was, my heart didnt want this >#

Its hard to explain due to the complexities of emotion and mission, but stunningly not one bit drew me to abandon my current path

Logically it was all there; comfort, cash, and pedigree that the Kellen Patrick Casebeers of the world are supposed to be gatekept out of

The easy path so to speak

So as it was meant to be, I kept the blinders on (to the bewilderment of everyone I know) & continue in this little mission of mine

Was reflecting on this recently & how much it means to be spending your time doing things that feel meaningful or important to you personally

Its too fun to ignore >#

Write to the person who says yes

Aka be precise with your language so that it maximally resonates with the person who is most likely to say yes

Most people write messages by taking the average or aggregate of their value props

Then send it to the average of their list (aka a made up mono-identity cast upon the entire market)

which resonates with no one (because were individuals and have our own identity& we want to feel special)

Across your list, most of the people are uninterested even if they knew exactly what you do

If you consider the psyche of someone who would say yes to any given offer, there usually are some factors that make this true

For what I do as an example, they may have already hired and fired a single sales rep before they connect with me and realize why their dabble in outbound failed

So Ill call that out in the copy

Be mindful not to attempt to appeal too broadly

Dont be vague with what you do or how you do it

Offer is still king, but positioning is frame control for the offer itself

Go deep on understanding what has been going on for the 3 months before someone is coming inbound - what are they thinking about - what are their curiosities?

Speak to that, and youll broaden the appeal and resonate w more than the small slice of the market in immediate buying windows

urn:li:activity:7260331514737881089,"In building account or TAM lists you need to understand precision vs recall (ML terms I learned from Graham Locklear)

Recall = the % of records of the total % that you bring in

High recall in tam building means every company in your tam is on your list

Precision = the % of records of the total % that are correctly identified

High precision means your list of 1000 is 1000 actual good targets

This is important to understand because theres a natural oscillation between refining for specificity and refining for reach

The best process starts with maximizing reach

Use Ocean.io , PandaMatch =< , and anything else you can get your hands on to build a big, fat account list

Focus on recall, NOT precision (unless the market is too big to process // then you can start w precise building)

Once you have a precise list, use Clay to enrich it and segment it.

The same research data youll use to disqualify poor-fit companies also helps you personalize to great/fit ones

As you whittle things down, youll end up with hyper-defined, well-researched, creatively grouped clusters of your target market

These unique clusters have a story in of themself; theres all sorts of messaging and narrative packed in once you divide the market this way

Once done, add the fields you created to crm & map the tam into there too

urn:li:activity:7259354076818079745,"Revenue plays complement more than they compete

There is no cold email vs cold call vs social vs ABM vs xyz&

This framing is used to sell revenue services or products

This would be like arguing if spoken or written word is better and saying you should stop ever using the other

Goals -> strategy to hit those goals -> tactics of how to carry out that strategy -> tooling to enable those tactics -> measurements against the tactics -> management of the people doing the tactics -> horsepower (human capital doing the tasks)

Thats usually how decisions are made; the level of prioritization 

Isolating tooling or workflows outside of the context of strategy or even what goals someone is trying to achieve is not a nice way to help clients succeed

~10% of phone numbers will be p1 / high frequency pickups aka 90% of your target market are not easily reachable by the phone

Email is imperfect in many ways you know; most companies will not win as much as they want to purely off email

Social is hit and miss by market, and much of what works is just momentary arbitrage of what email was; I get ai reps sending me the same poor messaging here as elsewhere 

The truth is theres no magic bullet

You usually will need to break your broader revenue goal down into smaller chunks, and then make milestones against those

For companies who have never tried outbound and have no idea if they have winning messaging are best served with email 

Social doesnt scale, and calling scales via talent vs more mechanical things; youll be more reliant on hiring + training (of people who dont want to stay in these roles) than if you can get email working

Email also is text based, so what someone says yes to is purely based on targeting, messaging and offer

Phones you introduce likability; only 10% of verbal communication is word choice aka you make it harder to distinguish between top reps vs top positioning

Day 1 you are likely best served choosing one single channel to dial in message market fit with and then broaden

Sometimes youll find shifting channels makes sense mid-testing

You can expedite net immediacy by throwing more $$$ at more channels but 2x spend usually = ~1.5x speed to understanding&

So it really really depends on what youre trying to do, how fast, and most importantly what youre willing to sacrifice to get there (usually between risk, cash, timeline, and ownership/control)

As you find winning things, which can be reached fastest and cheapest (usually) with outsourced type services who can sell their work for less than the tech stack they use on your behalf - youll want to embed them back in house usually

You can also totally run these in house - same idea - experiment fast, log what youre doing, and work through whats possible to narrow down into what (relatively) performs best

Step 0: you need healthy sending infrastructure; if you are DIYing this Maildoso will be your easiest path. Ideally use SMTP + Google + outlook as providers, so youll need Google and outlook +maildoso.

Step 1: download your current view of the market. Who is your buyer, why do they buy, what do non users do without you, what would you recommend they do if not use you, why is that worse, etc

Step 2: research the market a bit further, focus on their world aka the words and patterns of their thinking vs how vendors in their space frame things

Step 3: build a wide company list, usually using Ocean.io so we have a ton of reach

Step 4: load into Clay, add a bunch of proprietary data columns that let you filter the market more granularly and specifically than others selling to similar people. Use ZenRows, ChatGPT, LeadMagic, etc

Step 5: harvest contacts out of the ideal-fit companies; use a mix of Prospeo.io, Icypeas, and maybe another to maximize coverage of email addresses 

Step 6: validate the emails

Step 7: write unique copy to each persona you identified, leveraging the segments you created to tell a story this person hasnt heard before. Make copy focused on them, what theyre facing, how they can change it; dont focus on you at all

Step 8: load all of this into Smartlead, send send send :)

Step 9: monitor using EmailGuard, reply quickly, and iterate based on quant + qual feedback

That's because ""Message Market Fit"" is an entirely different way of connecting to the market.

If PMF = what people will buy when they believe they have a problem, know how you solve that problem, and see your price as agreeable

Then MMF = what people will respond to when you communicate to them

MMF is antifragile because as long as you control for your inputs, whether an experiment fails or succeeds, you move the ball forward by zeroing in on what performs best

To crush MMF, you need to consider things like identify and palatability

Identity = the concept of who someone believes themself to be internally, or the automated subconscious programming that runs on our behalf. We need to consider this for our market to ideally land a message.

Palatability = the concept of how excited someone would be to hear your message or accept it as true. A lot of sales dev outreach basically reads as ""hey here's how you suck at your job"" and is something no one will want to accept.

These sorts of messages read more like ""Hey Sam, looked like {company} {observational truth that makes them stand out / is unique to observe}. Is balancing {force 1} and {force 2} while pursuing {outcome} a current challenge? Let me know if I could share how we helped {customer} {achieve thing that your prospect would want}""

Understanding ""face-value"" value props =/= understanding how you help your market.

Some of the greatest ever have them; the narrator posed the question of whether these cinema legends were prone to mistakes or if something else was going on

One example was in the goodfellas where one character is smoking a cigar from one cut and when it jumps to another angle he isnt

As it ends up - it just looked cooler that way

In other movies, these cuts are more of a means of artistic expression; with films like American psycho or spring breakers or requiem for a dream using inconsistencies and broken timelines similar to how Salvador Dali quite literally bent time in some of his paintings

Most of you won't have any idea what that means if you read a technical explanation (aka youre not the intended audience), so here's me walking through a simple visual

The Tldr:

- Your email provider (google vs outlook vs smtp) impacts who can receive your emails

- Your prospects' email provider impacts who they receive messages from

- These are VARIABLE accelerators/decelerators (aka what works rn will not be the same as what does 4 weeks from now)

- In order to stay ahead, you need MULTIPLE sending servers (google, outlook, SMPT) to be able to maximize delivery in any given moment

- You also need to actively be measuring placement or you risk sending to servers you cannot deliver to (even without bounce errors)

- The pros are now creating multiple sequences per set of copy so they can isolate sending to google vs outlook vs private server prospects

- Increasingly, it will not make sense for companies to attempt to run their own outbound email processes; whether you work with someone else to do A->Z outbound or just a partner who handles deliverability, you're going to need help

urn:li:activity:7254169025637699585,"Back when I first started The Deal Lab, we had to turn away people who only wanted help with domain infrastructure and not our done-for-you cold email services.

It made a big difference who�owned the domains // workspaces when we used Google, and the operational headaches of managing domains for clients didn't make sense for us at the time.

Over time, two factors have lead to a slight change vs how we used to approach this (aka turning people away who need help here):

1) Email deliverability has gotten harder // the cycles of which�it changes have gotten shorter.

It used to be you could statically ""set up"" healthy infrastructure and walk away.

Today, changes are constant�and being prepared means planning ahead vs being reactive to what google and the other email providers do.

We love the market and seek to serve it (you?), and we realized some companies really need help re: figuring out how to deliver emails, but don't want us to help with data�and copy (yet&)

2) We got better.

Day 1, we used simple sending infrastructure to more or less ""check the box"" in our work helping clients find Message Market Fit.

A year and a half later, we (like everyone else serious about email delivery) use a blend between traditional providers such as Gmail and newer server products hosted outside of google/microsoft.

It's no longer crazy�to be doing this.

In general, redundancy is a good idea and having plan B and C in place before plan A blows up is wise.

As an example, companies like Maildoso�make it easy for YOU (as in random, non technical email deliverability people) to set up alternative email sending infrastructure.

They provide cold-email-specific inboxes that you can plug into your email sending platform (I am a Smartlead fan as you all know).

This is useful if you need to contain costs to experiment and lack technical knowledge to DIY inboxes.

It can be daunting to figure out which email infrastructure is best and how to manage it all - I am curious what you all currently think / wonder / or know about this (especially startups / brands vs agencies...

Heuristics that let them more quickly determine who is a good for & what to say based on these factors

We had a nice process; wed build a tech stack together, map out a sales process, create metrics + an onboarding plan, hire some reps, train them, and Id work with CEOs/COOs/CMOs to teach them how to take over these teams once we left

When clients pay you $20k per month, theres a lot of expectations (urgency) due to the bleed rate

That works great if you can quickly start building immediate pipeline; sometimes a company wins simply by telling the market they serve hey we do xyz and they start booking meetings

It DOES NOT WORK GREAT (have seen this now dozens and dozens of times) to throw a ton of $$$ blindly into a total unknown situation

Meaning - without historical data on working outbound& message market fit as I call it& 

Its tough to deliver value quickly enough at 20k per month to make it sustainable

The more 0 to 1 things are, the more that it often makes sense to test & validate message market fit before you invest in more reps // a heavier weighted engagement

I started The Deal Lab because I knew I could charge a small fraction of what we did as consultants and provide higher quality work

How?

By being incredibly focused on helping companies do 4 things incredibly well:

1. Identify and segment their target market more granularly and with more specificity than they ever have before

2. Leverage the breadth of best-in-class technologies for building lists, enriching data, and sending messages; I knew I could centralize tech stack and allow clients to gain access to more tools than would make sense for a company starting on their own (huge advantage for agencies)

3. Write compelling, unique, creative, and proven effective email campaigns (have always been a strong writer, other agencies hire me to do this for them, i have never lost a head to head test w a client)

4. Analyzing the results we receive, adapting based on market resonance, and iterating to understand where opportunity lies

By the end of a pilot (how we start all engagements), well be able to tell you if we have scalable campaigns vs requiring more R&D to scale vs not currently in a position to see ROI from cold email

In theory people are trying to avoid that last scenario; my belief is there are inevitabilities that lie between what you do and the market you want to serve

The faster you can run quality tests to validate what works // doesnt, the faster you can move forward

Most talk about outbound is about optimizing working things & tactics you can apply to situations where you already resonate w the market // have an idea of what works for you particular product

Theres less people focused on true 0 to 1, in situations that require more hands on work

Imagine you help medical practices, so you build an Ocean.io list and start with a few thousand in-ICP companies (20+ locations, not part of major health system, etc)

Some companies will succeed running messaging to that list alone; many actively struggle to make this work.

So we peel back the onion a few layers.... 

To start we learn that SOME medical practices take part in a Medicare program that makes them a uniquely strong fit. This can be found on their website, so we can easily crawl the site and categorize Yes/No + the reasoning so we can use it later (qualitative research)

Anyone who is a Yes will get sent to a campaign specifically for these Medicare participants.

If they're not participating, we check if they are PE/VC owned. If yes, they go to a unique campaign.

Also if yes, we find the PE group name, and send them to a third campaign (we grab the operating partner tied to the healthcare vertical, otherwise any operating partner). This campaign has a broader value prop based on how my client can serve the portfolio.

Next we check the remaining companies to see if they operate 24/7 or not. If yes, they go to one campaign and if no they go to another.

So we end up with these 5 unique segments that are definitely not available from out-of-the-box data tools.

1) 20+ location medical practices participating in AWVs

2) 20+ location medical practices owned by PE groups (+ the PE group name)

3) PE groups who own 20+ location medical practices (+ the practice names)

4) 20+ location medical practices who are NOT 24-hour service

5) 20+ location medical practices who ARE 24-hour service (and not fitting any of the above, which gives a lot of attributes as well...)

MOST companies will be able to take lists of this level specificity (we have the validated email + phones for target contacts at all of them) & turn it into more revenue than they're currently seeing from whatever they're doing today.

If you can't, I'll spin up the campaigns to validate your value props against your market through this lens for you.

They perceive the benefits of this technology to be immense

They perceive the time it takes to learn it to be above average

In my head Im wondering why a capable person would be off-put by this gap rather than dive in

Then I remember humans are wired for survival, not to thrive

Our primary drivers are threat detection and self preservation; not ascending maslows hierarchy

Most living creatures experience 0 seconds of life outside of pure survival

Its a uniquely human experience to partake in picking and choosing through life

Its ruining us

If you think of great human accomplishments, they all come facing challenge head on

It used to be that the most capable men and women would dedicate themselves to advancing society in some way, and the burden wed bare for others was a source of pride and value in our community

If you zoom out enough in life it mostly all looks the same (a few blinks of an eye between the infinite time before life and infinite time after death)

We do some research on top of the intake form they complete + assets they send (client calls, previous campaigns, marketing materials, videos, etc) & then present it back tot hem ""in our words""

That partially means in a way that I would train an SDR or AE on what I just learned, and also a little bit of how we codify that strategy into Ocean.io-built company lists that we send into Clay to filter down further

Inside of there we start thinking of dividing lines we can draw that are unique to our relationship to the market; aka what can we say to prospects that will uniquely resonate/show we understand them/lets us literally filter by.

((Just like we do company size, industry, etc... plenty fair game.... this just allows creatives to paint a moire vivid picture... or engineers who can break things down more granularly... ))

You end up with this unique, 1:1 dataset; your lens on the market.

Currently I'm helping a few companies ""map this"" into their CRMs and build auto-enrichment processes to make sure any data inside there ALWAYS has these properties

Cool ones that worked super well:

- # of acquisitions in last 20 years

- Acquisition detail (the research against that, used to make hyper specific arguments re: team integration + unification of L&D)

- Whether a construction org does Facade/Bridge/Building/Utility/Gas Inspections

- Who the PE group was that owned a medical practice

- Whether they owned multiple on the list

- Who the Operating Partner is over the deal

- Their Emails (we booked a CEO of a niiiiiiiice firm the other day)

- Whether they integrate into healthcare PII systems

- Whether someone is between 50-70% SOC2 compliant (kinda sketchy but cool)

Once you do a bunch of this, you have lets say 7 different slices of the market, all with a unique set of ""angles"" or arguments to test against

You may even multiply that across a few personas... ends up with maybe 30-100 combos of angle->persona->segment->market...

Grab 3-10 of them per month, run tests, cross off losers and circle winners, optimize in the context of what you are seeing work/not more than what you hear works/doesn't.

Test lots. 70% of what you do should be known-campaigns split 35/35, and the remaining 30% gets split 10/10/10 in net-new tests. 

If you're getting ""we're dying if we dont improve this"" then feel free to do more like 20/20/20/20/20 testing....

Give it 4 months minimum, ideally 8, even 12. Alex hormozi lost money for 9 months, broke even month 10, and in month 11 profited enough to cover all 11 put together

Most people hire months 1-3 over and over between a million different providers, fire each once before doing the next thing the same way ad nauseam (til failure); you need to find month 7-8-9-10-11 somewhere... make a play

The way we map this makes it easy to run these tests fast & decisively

The art of helping people change their behaviors is called coaching

As humans, we we are wired to preserve energy when possible (need to leave fuel in the tank for survival situations).

Which means ANYthing left to it's default state will tend to degrade over time.

A parallel to life...

The linebacker who benches 405 in college will fail 225 in their 40s if they stop training.

I use the analogy of weight loss to think about coaching, because it is so universal.

Most people would be happy to lose a little belly fat; it would require nothing to do so.

As in, if you stood there and waited for 72 hours, you'd have less fat!

No knowledge is required, no program, no tool, no gear, nothing at all.

Yet no one does this; why?

BEHAVIORS & HABITS

They're ""addicted"" to who they are, and their daily patterns are so strongly engrained in their brains that it is genuinely a challenge to abstain from expelling that energy to go grab the tub of ice cream.

A million miles to your right is the tip of what is possible today based on technological advances & human innovation. Over there you'll find SpaceX, modern medicine, and all sorts of crazy things.

But a million miles to your left is the point to where most humans operate; they do little to take advantage of the tools, knowledge, and support around them. They are spiritually defeated and/or exhausted. They are illogical.

Show me a sales team struggling, and I will show you a team operating BEHIND where they could be.

You could give them chatgpt super subscriptions, night vision goggles, and 50 copies of never split the difference and they would still fail.

Tools will not get you to where you want to go; they are not and never will be the real gap between you and your dreams.

Only by putting one foot in front of the other, off into the unknown outside of your comfort zone, will you find what you seek

The real question we'll dive into is WHY segment your lists?

In short, what you know = what you can say.

The more granular & strategic you are with how you codify the way you look at the market, the easier it becomes to communicate the value you bring to them.

The old way was using static fields pre-selected by the apollos and zoominfos of the world to filter in known, predictable ways

Attempts to ""personalize"" off this data fall short partially because the fields the data tools provide ARE a pattern in of themself.

Going beyond the patterned reasons for contacting someone, tools like Clay let us creatively define entirely NEW, PROPRIETARY variables

By being 1 of 1 to filter the world this way, we arrive with unique messages vs your competitors

Move 2: I left a nice career/oriented sales job (above) to join a scrappy super-early stage startup alongside Bryan Smith. 

Totally changed my life.

This was a decade of experience in a year and a half on startups, product development, message market fit, early gtm, and so much more.

I knew I wanted to become a founder, and when I met Bryan I was extremely interested in developing under his leadership. 

Passion, energy, empathy, delegation& it was powerful to be given a true seat at a table vs just sell a product.

I also got to develop my personal brand largely echoing off Bryans vision, and I believe that energy remains in my writing / thinking. We geeked out over antifragile / taleb too.

Made my career imo. Conceded some comp, 1000x roi on that concession - 100 out of 100 would recommend.

Move 3: I quit entrepreneurship to get a w2 again. I was aimless my first go around; I had skills, belief, etc but no idea how to build a business around that. 

I had the pleasure of working for Joey Gilkey for a season who is a master of building high value sales offers that meet the market where it needs to be met. 

I learned how to package services, make a statement of work, present to value. I also got to operate on the service side and deliver a set of services / validate my ability to be that guy to someone working through building a 0->1 outbound operation

I also got to help chip away at a goal for a service business from the inside and see what it takes to operate profitably.

Joey always teased me that Id go do my own thing; it half bugged me because I am a team player guy through and through& but I believed he believed it and that was a nice affirmation that maybe I could the next time it made sense to give it a swing 

-

Im someone who knew Id do my own thing eventually; these steps were the building blocks of making that happen. 

Its a different path than simply becoming a really good seller inside of a company - not better or worse

Given how well Ive seen these experiences transition smoothly to The Deal Lab, others with similar goals may gain from considering moves like this as well

urn:li:activity:7234640243604238336,"1 year and and 10 months ago I wrote a guide titled Defining Message Market Fit to organize my beliefs around what it looks like to asymmetrically win at outbound

At the time I had never heard the term used to convey this idea of cold audience resonance, but was operating as a consultant inside of a dozen and a half b2b companies who were building outbound motions 

Some were winning

Others losing

All of them were doing the same general motions, but in the losers we found that it wasnt enough to simply share what we did with the market / how we could help

The founders/sales leaders of these companies were frantically trying to drive us forward

But I saw that we needed a patient, thoughtful approach 

In order to articulate some of my thoughts around why it made sense to more granularly segment the market, and spend more time developing hyper-specific messaging , this guide was born 

Since then I think the term has become more broadly used - no ownership to me - but more of a nod that my senses around where the market would be heading were affirmed

Ive built a business around mapping markets and validating resonance.

Today I got to participate in a webinar talking about some of the ways I turn these ideas into campaigns, and it was a fun reminder of how hungry the market is for info

urn:li:activity:7229269467552235520,"The 2 core elements of communication re: cold outbound:

Signal & Receptivity

1) Signal - aka the core message of what you are saying.

For an email from me at The Deal Lab, a core message (aka the signal itself) could be viewed as:

we will help you design and run cold outbound experiments to acquire new customers

From this lens, you want to be sure you are clear, specific, and direct. 

Your prospects will not think on your behalf, so you want to ensure your message clearly defines the core signal it is intending to deliver.

Many stop here, but this is a mistake.

Signal alone is our world aka what we want to say - and often this prospect has seen this concept countless times before

Its a pattern itself honestly 

Go back to my companys core signal above - it sucks as a stand alone value prop

Enter&

2) Receptivity - aka how you package your core signal to make it palatable

This is where you inject empathy

That empathy comes from what you understand about this person& the list is the strategy as they say 

Problem intimacy is another phrase I like here - how well do you understand the inner workings of the problem (think workflow level and specific we help you automate dns record setup and provide fully configured domains plugged into Smartlead with zero manual steps) 

vs 

simply the marketing headline of the problem (think simplistic value props like we help you save time on xyz&)

I use the dichotomy of my world vs their world where if i grab them by their collar and try to pull them into my world (my way of thinking or speaking about a problem) they will jerk away

But if i come in cool and calm, sound like i know what Im talking about, people will lean in a bit and invite the discussion 

A lot of gains can be made to receptivity by using language that calls out and preempts objections.

Strong offers also help here.

A sample to fix The Deal Labs value prop might be along the lines of we have a method for mapping your market and rapidly testing value props within your ICP.

Would it be helpful to look at this live?

Or can I rewrite your current sequences to see if I outperform your team?

Havent lost a head to head yet&. (If I want to be offer centric)

A lot of bad outbound happens from speaking about ourselves completely outside the context of how a prospect is likely to (obviously) perceive your message

-

Balance your focus on signal & receptivity -dial in the latter with more emphasis once youve proven out simpler phrasing 

Be intentional about what mechanisms youre using to support each of these as well (I.e. pattern interrupt is a receptivity mechanism whereas soft CTAs are signal-centric)

Meaning there are times its better to do something for free than it is to try to charge anything

One example is when the people believe in your value but arent sure how to get started; remove friction by just doing a free project 

The two best clients are:

1. people who know exactly what they need and trust you to get it done

2. People who have no idea what they need but trust you to help them get it done

The first group pays in full up front and you owe them the world (in a good way); true believers

The second group may be hesitant initially but if you become a beacon of traction and advancement youll become irreplaceable 

What you can charge for the first engagement is Pennies on the dollar vs what youll be able to do once they know youre great

Its fragile if the only way you serve your market is charging full price for core services - the wider you can expand your ability to support your target audience = more at bats = more wins

I saw Jordan Crawford & >�Eric Nowoslawski posting about it, and knew the workflows and creativity that this tool unlocked was the future of how people like me would drive revenue for b2b companies.

A few months into using the tool, and I realized this provides the GTM Artist in me with a canvas to paint the way my brain thinks.

Dedication to learning the tool taught me APIs, which unlocked a whole new tier of benefits (Thank you Jesse Ouellette for the influence).

Last week I had a publicly traded IT services client book a call with a VP of IT off of a FULLY AUTOMATED flow that went something like:

RSS feed from Apple podcasts pushes to Clay -> scrape the web URL with ZenRows -> summarize the interview with ChatGPT -> extract the interviewee's name using GPT -> use Clay's ""claygent"" ai web crawler to find the person's LinkedIn URL -> use LeadMagic to grab their phone number + email address + professional summary -> use GPT to summarize this person and extract key accomplishments -> each line of the email is uniquely prompted -> sent into Smartlead...

(It doesn't end there)

We then use Ocean.io to find 10 companies similar to the interviewee's -> send those to a new clay table -> repeat the steps above but with the angle of ""Not sure if you saw Jordan's interview talking about XYZ but thought you might be interested in....""

Result is FREE intent data (RSS > every saas i know of in the intent space), automated research, and incredibly custom 1 to 1 emails going out and getting meetings with buyers that this company has otherwise struggled to meet with via cold messaging.

Really stoked to join a bunch of people I admire & respect in the Expert program, and even more so for what this means for The Deal Lab clients as we continue to grow.

urn:li:activity:7223151594714939392,"As a young sales rep you often make the mistake of operating from a place of fear 

Was talkin with some friends today about how to manage nerves for big sales calls

Its cliche almost - but you gotta detach 

If youre nervous, its usually because youre stressing about controlling things you cannot control 

You want to wring this prospect out for your behalf, even if you dont realize it

Youre focused on what youll say, and when youre talking you arent learning

Youre focused on an outcome you want but havent ran the disco / has the discussion yet

Youre trying to memorize your side of things but thats putting energy to the wrong place

I argue for minimal prep on an acute level, meaning the nth next call should not really be that crazy different than the rest 

But maximal prep on knowing your services and market and how to help people.

If you treat people like a normal person, youll be fine. Youre not going to magically forget important things and youre not going to mess up beyond repair.

Where you will destroy your chances is failing to be empathetic, being shallow with discovery, or worse feature selling to someone who lacks context for your solutions 

If you show up excited to learn, happy to share, and confident that no matter what happens in the aggregate of your career any single moment is relative meaningless; youll show up fine

Confident and fine over time becomes potent and LETHAL.

But as a young rep, everything feels more important than it is.

Youre often desperate to impress your company to get promoted (maybe faster than you should be), desperate to make money (you heard sales makes a lot and youre barely clearing $55k), and desperate to reconcile the identity you have for yourself (capable) with the reality youre facing (you havent w2d 100k or gotten a promotion yet)

Sadly, many abandon their dreams because theyre too impatient to get great

If you internalize that the BASE / FOUNDATION of a great seller is abundance and confidence, then youd understand that the act of pretending to be confident and pretending not care will lead you to seeing that these behaviors drive more wins

And as you see that wins are available to you, youll care less to force them

And thus - you become the thing you were pretending to be&

Momentum builds

Eventually that same 23 year old sitting at 555 mission street getting his ass handed to him day in and day out is doing things they never dreamt of

Commitment to excellence is underrated

Give before you receive; you need to love it too, you cannot just give TO receive

urn:li:activity:7223031505994883072,"12 years ago I made my first ever cold call

I was 17, working in a home theater / automation company in the Bay Area that serviced high end residential buyers 

Out shop a ton of McIntosh Laboratory, Inc. products 

So they have me call some cold , old lead lists&

Same skillset I used to go from $15 / hr there to $50k / yr as an SDR, $120k / yr as an AE, and later jump into GTM leadership roles to drive pipeline, sales, and wicked happy customers

In that time, theres been two constants:

1. People talking about the world changing, technology shifting how work is done, and the possibility of roles being eliminated for robots 

2. Ive stfu and made my d*mn cold calls and outperformed 95% of teammates Ive sat next to re: pipe gem

Theres lots of opinions out there, theyre all equal in rights to be voiced, but not equal in being grounded by reality 

Im hesitant to overindex on anyone whos never built a business or team - people who have only ever operated inside of a world that someone else created for them lack some perspective that makes it easy to toss insane ideas out there for people to pile onto

Many of them are basically rooted in coping by ignoring the work that needs to be done, trying to gain consensus that xyz-methodology is not viable so they can feel better about struggling, or worse shilling their own new fancy diet-pill-esque GTM approach.

Today, right this moment, some of the most successful companies in the world (billions of revenue) have unusable CRMs, with zero automation tools, no data tool (they do it the old school way!), no blueprint for success, and still PRINT cash

So with all due respect, when sub 20k MRR founder / 1 month old agency operator / random rep has zealot-like takes on the GTM sky falling - I think its healthy to take it with a quarter of a grain of salt or so&

urn:li:activity:7222246897216839680,"I recently resurrected the success of a client who wed struggled to get wins for at first

Heres the story & what it means for you

After mapping out their markets -> the segments of those markets -> the personas we could target in these markets -> the angles we can leverage to reach out to them&

We launched our first campaigns 

Month 1 we did hit a few targets - and saw only a little bit of life among 1 of the 5 wed gone after

The next month, we did a second take on that + a second take on this clients most valuable (but more challenging) targets 

(For context: they target large healthcare organizations as well as small healthcare saas companies& the saas ones are easier and where wed seen some life)

This second month we did WORSE

Now at face value it means wed taken a step backwards, but thats because people think the most valuable thing to chase is a closed deal

It isnt

The most valuable asset from doing outbound is developing an accurate understanding of what resonates with an ice cold market that doesnt know you yet

Selling deals to people who know you is easier than getting strangers who dont know you to come speak with you

Having the ability to get those people to reliably and consistently talk with you is the most potent path to those deals you wanted a second ago 

So we launch the next campaign 

I made adjustments based on what DIDNT work last month; no response is a strong clue to what people dont care about

So if I know that a market cares about an idea, but my copy didnt hit, I know I need to angle from the opposite side

The campaign that didnt work was focused on speed to integration and being able to integrate with hundreds of companies more easily

My theory for why it didnt work is that by the time a decision is made to build integrations, resources have already been allocated, so hitting up the people owning that = DOWNstream of the core strategic decision (build integration) so its hard to redirect that to buying them instead

So I ponder

Maybe I can entice product managers and founders to DREAM of expanded capabilities. I realized that we can dangle the idea of new, easy revenue by suggesting with us they can add a ton of capabilities that they havent considered yet

To hit in pain aversion, I use language asking how often they lose a deal to a competitor over some random one off integration 

I ask if they would be able to close more deals if they could add any integration in days vs weeks/months

The 10 days after launching this new angle, we got some sort of positive (or more) every single day + LOTS of really good negative replies sharing thoughtful explanations of why were not a good fit right now 

Massive unlock 

We share this with our clients team, and they get to work applying this to marketing, product, website, and everything else 

Outbound is the truth; you can diagram your ideas all day long but only launched campaigns drive results

6 months later when given my review, I was offered a $0.05 per hour raise (I was making $8.50) so I quit on the spot.

Used that job to fund my final 2 years at a 4-year college (I'd spent 5 prior attending junior college part time) while working trade job in the morning, an office furniture rental job in the afternoon, and then selling gym memberships on nights i didn't have class or the weekend.

More granular definition = more specificity with messaging = deeper resonance (when you get it right)

Once you find winning combos that can yield asymmetrical results, you exploit them by running the play to its most scaled potential until it either runs dry or fades in effectiveness

But we saw churn due to lack of net meeting count at times, and the markets demand is so centric in volume (this is a demand side issue as much as a supply side one fwiw) that it incentivizes agencies to increase volume and decrease potency

When you use the waterfall mechanism, it searches for an email first -> and then if it finds one it sends it to neverbounce or zerobounce or whatever you have set up for your validation tool

If the validation passes then the waterfall stops and it sends the valid email forward; if the validation fails then it repeats with the next vendor

But the thing is, Findymail finds & validates catch-alls

Which is unique vs the other verification tools

So a Findymail search that returns an email MAY find a catch-all email but still return it since they can validate that

Here's where the issue happens

If you send that validated (via Findymail) email into a regular verifier next, it will return as a catch-all!

Many perfect-match people simply use ""product"" (which registers as entry level even though manually checking these contacts found many ex-founders with successful exits under their belt), but searching ""product"" will sneakily return product marketers, product engineers, product designers, founders with product in their title, and many more wacky titles that I'd never intend to target.

The solution is to use A LOT of exclusions; assume that there is no such thing as a good contact search that is absent of exclusions.

Other data platforms probably do a lot of the same, so feel free to apply this using whatever else you use.

Tight list = specificity in reaching out = higher likelihood of success

urn:li:activity:7211766521629487105,"The decision to try to do outbound should not be made through the lens that youll run it for 30-60 days and then pull the plug if its not ROI positive

Heres 3 reasons why

1. The best outbound month isnt reliant on pure net new cold outbound 

If you imagine a world 12 months from now where youve committed to outbound, the % of meetings you book are likely something like

- 50% follow-ups from previous months 
- 50% net new cold contacts 

Which means that even if you could enter month 1 fully ramped, youd book half the calls you will over time 

2. The ROI is longer term than youre judging by.

In a month where you sent 1000 people messages and booked 5 of them, youve also made some sort of impression on 995 others (ok not exactly since not everyone sees your message)

But the point is that over time these impressions create openness to working with you 

Youll get more inbounds, more referrals, deals will close faster, you develop deeper problem intimacy, amonth other factors by doing outbound 

Even just mapping your market out like one should to do outbound will provide a new (improved) lens on who you serve & why they like you 

3. The asset of a repeatable successful outbound engine is way more valuable than its given credit 

When cold outbound hums, youd be hard pressed to find a more asymmetrical growth lever.

Where $5k spend for $0 revenue month 1 or 2 may feel painful, the prize we are chasing is a world where youre seeing $50k-$100k+ in realized revenue off that same $5k spend 

Alex hormozi talks about building outbound for Acquisition.com & shares this timeline 

Months 1-3: 0 sales, team asked him to pull the plug

Months 4-6: a couple sales, running the program at a loss, team asked him to pull the plug 

Months 6-9: achieved break even between expenses vs revenue, not enough ROI to justify long term, team asked him to pull the plug 

Month 10: same as above

Month 11: profited so much, it covered all 11 months of investment + profit left over

Month 12 & onward: consistent revenue growth via outbound 



A business like mine that helps setup and dial in outbound can massively expedite this timeline, but theres inevitabilities outside of our control 

You chose your product 

You chose the markets you want to serve

You designed your offer

The choice to attempt to make outbound works should be a strategic decision with some level of commitment behind it.

The best outcomes are better than you realize, but often a little slower too.

Sometimes youll see big wins fast (had an ecom client close 2x $200k deals off campaigns we ran), but thats not typical

urn:li:activity:7211206405951746048,"Heres the first 3 things I do with every single client to maximize the effectiveness of our outbound campaigns

1. Segment the market incredibly granularly

I look for the markets they serve and the segments of those markets

Segments for me is anything that meaningfully changes what I will say to them

What meaningfully changes your messaging is based on what you do - you may want to play around with dicing things up differently to see how these changes flow through your actual copy

A great example is that I may work differently with:

- a startup with no sales leader where the founder has no sales background 

- a startup with no sales leader where the founder does have a sales background 

- a startup with a sales leader in place

- a startup with a sales consultant in place

2. Map each persona and the angles you have for working with them

Pain is an observation or idea, but angle to me adds argument to the idea.

Good outbound means arriving with an opinion, and mapping different ways you can state why each persona (specific to each segment of each market) helps keep these things organized 

It also means when you control for those 4 inputs (market, segment, persona, angle) - the outcomes you receive are relatively repeatable vs something less controlled for

3. Explore just how many contact records exist for each of these buckets of people

Its surprisingly common that a companys TAM they said to their investors is one thing, and then the market they actually serve ends up being way smaller (due to it being a lot harder than most realize to go win over a cold audience into becoming a customer) 

By mapping the availability of the people you have to target, you can balance quantity of audience with potency of angle to prioritize what you want to test 

Bonus: from there use a channel like email, phone, or social media to run your messages against that audience & drive for positive outcomes 

Rinse & repeat monthly, ride it out a year, and on the other side youll have optimized a number of those combinations of market - segment - persona to yield a half decent & pretty consistent flow of cold outbound opportunities 

This exercise is useful in of itself, but paired with someone who can quickly execute these campaigns - it doesnt take long to test viability via cold outbound

urn:li:activity:7211086416972238851,"My favorite story in the world is the story of Icarus

In order to escape imprisonment, Icarus fashioned a set of wings out of wax and feathers

His father warned him that if he were to fly too low & close to the sea, that the humidity would cause the wings to saturate with water and eventually fail

Additionally, Icarus father warned that if he flies too high (aka close to the sun), that the wax would melt and the wings would fail.

From prison, all Icarus could think about was escaping - and he knew flight was his way out. Nothing would stop him; he would fly as hard as he could

Predictably, he bit off more than he could chew by flying too close to the sun and plummeted to the sea where he drowned.

The lesson here is that we must be mindful of ambition & where it may lead us. As we succeed in life, our approach to effort and goals should change too.

Let me explain 

In this case, a client (very reasonably) had strong opinions about how we should talk to their market.

Theyve been in the field, they have customer advisors, and they have ran some tests themself before we engaged

They had some positive replies, but no scale whatsoever & lacked predictability

When we began our engagement, I found that there was healthy disagreement around copy. 

My belief is that its important to leverage a clients lens on their market, but once youve run so many campaigns you also develop a sense for what good looks like.

After airing out our perspectives, I realized there was no way theyd see the world from my eyes if I didnt prove it.

Plus I accepted that maybe theyre right - Im always open to being shown better ways of operating.

So we ran their copy:

3,871 sends
17 replies
0 positive

Aka fail& this basically meant the market did NOT CARE about what we were saying to them 

Then we ran mine:

1,833 sends
26 replies
3 positives 

Aka signs of life. By no means is this f yeah territory but it shows that we can manipulate levers to improve outcomes & gives us a thread to pull on towards strong market resonance

Also, will once shared about supporting loom because their cto was engaging on twitter w customers.

I feel the same here - Will jumped on a call w me super early when I was at LEON when he didnt need to & that stood out.

3. Jordan Crawford. Jordans put out a lord of the rings series length library of YouTube videos mixing markets + messaging + ai in order to create cool growth campaigns.

urn:li:activity:7206004818467782656,"Everyone agrees that trust is needed in sales

Which begs the question how can I built trust?

Heres a perspective on that, based on evolution & psychology (yes I am using boof logic to help you trust this argument)

A close friend was exploring what it takes to proactively build trust, and how we as sellers can do so with prospects

The visual to consider is two powerful animals at a watering hole out in the wild

Lets say animal 1 (lion) sees animal 2 (tiger), and they immediately posture up at each other ready to battle, a perfectly natural reaction to a potential threat

(Reminder: living creatures are wired for survival, not to thrive. Our #1 focus is threat mitigation, and we will do insane things to avoid threat. Dont assume intention in situations where someone may be acting off fear.)

If the lion wants to build trust with the tiger, it ends up the best thing it can do is simply turn its back and take a sip of water.

Why?

It is making itself vulnerable, aka exposed to threat. 

By allowing itself to be open to attack, the lion tells the tiger it means no ill intent, and by making itself vulnerable - the tiger is more likely to trust the lion will not attack it if it were to do the same.

Being vulnerable builds trust, not visa versa.

By admitting openly to shortcomings, highlighting imperfections, and focusing on the truth over what serves you - you as a seller can proactively build trust.

Alex hormozi has a framework for selling where you share the negatives first (I.e. its going to take a lot of effort, youll need to commit to 6 months before knowing if it will work, and its not going to be cheap either way) 

BEFORE the positives 

(Aka hed finish with BUT if we do that its possible youll walk away with a repeatable sales process that consistently books you new sales calls with your target market).

Point being - dont be shady; transparency and confidence will serve you much more.

urn:li:activity:7205709813907902465,"""Offer Congruency"" is how I describe the idea of having your offer match your brand, abilities, and reason why someone would hire you.

This comes up for newer service business owners who are unsure whether they should do retainers vs performance only vs a blend

But it also is relevant for other businesses trying to crack the code on why their market may want to talk with them

At the center is becoming more empathetic towards your market (the corporate buzzword for learning to understand through their senses vs your own).

In the ""help people build and run email systems and other GTM automations"" world here's a few examples of the types of players that exist & how their offers can be congruent to what the market wants.

1) Cold email only people: Meaning they have only sent cold emails. There are a lot of people, especially on the younger side, who learned to do cold email and offer this as a service. 

They themself have committed to somewhat of a commodity, as they are often repeating someone else's model, maybe as part of a coaching plan.

This is where I've seen a lot of ""performance only"" offers, as they have less proof usually around capabilities (and usually all they bring to the table is the ability to do this).

Making no-risk offers is good for acquiring customers - it just attracts a lot of the ones you may not want. You take on a lot of risk here. 

I believe a ton of the negative reputation ""lead gen"" businesses have comes from here, but there's also instances of great practitioners here so I am not knocking it :) 

2) Automation based agencies: these businesses are hyper-focused on removing manual effort from their workflows. They do a great job of defining models and ways of doing things.

I am not sure the market wants to buy automated services, but the times they do is because they believe it can get them results on the thing it is doing. This gets flushed out quickly - and there are some awesome examples of it crushing.

Not everyone wins using these though, and when this approach fails it usually means you need to go work with someone else to chase success.

3) Fractional Rep freelancers: These are usually ex-AEs or ex-SDRs doing work as a freelancer type.

They tend to execute the thing you lay out for them, but offer little beyond the effort & outcomes. Again - plenty of sharp reps out there - but there's a richer lens that can be applied (I like Wayne Morris's model through GTM phases if you aren't familiar).

This can be a big win win in the right scenario; many companies accidentally hire these though when they need more leaders at the helm though, so be mindful.

4) Agency / Consultancy hybrids: I am biased, but for me it is most fun to run a business that does the work described in the above but through the lens of being adaptable (like startups operate).

In my experience, what makes the most sense as ""the next thing to do"" can change quickly & one of the greatest flaws of the businesses listed 1-3 is (cont below...)",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7205709813907902465,,1 year ago,kellen-casebeer,ACoAABusnpABTh_8asVVMbMZKoJGP6RK238_MTA,Kellen,Casebeer,Helping companies find Message-Market-Fit | Founder @ The Deal Lab | Smartlead Certified Partner | Clay Certified Expert,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQGLoHpREQ6ivQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1672696747667?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=AIi72wDQ8Z6nYybZdmj_qK1DZQxJ3AeDD6LxQVUMLF8,,,,,,True,No,No,No
urn:li:activity:7205636492327571456,"I believe that in order to truly master a skill you need someone in each of these 3 roles

1. Someone who teaches you.

Yes you can self learn, but if youre doing 0 to 1 something that has already been solved for, then youre going to go a lot slower recreating the wheel

As a business owner I look to people like Alex Boyd or Leila Hormozi for wisdom as theyve done what I want to already & share thinking through that lens.

Id youre lucky, you have direct mentorship, but in my life Ive mostly scrapped by extracting insights from free and public materials. Being able to self source the info you need is a massive skill in of itself.

2. Someone to compete with.

Whether on friendly terms or not, competition breeds excellence.

The whole 4-minute mile thing is a good example, where a cluster of people were able to hit this time once a single person proved it was possible.

Having something to compare against directly makes things matter more now, and keeps you on your game. 

The innovation of LLMs as an example has gone up since more came out.

This all is the phenomenon of anti fragility in action. 

3. Someone to teach / mentor.

Youll never learn more deeply than when codifying things to teach others.

The kicker is you need to have something worth teaching >#

This is one of the main benefits of social media or YouTube where youre sharing ideas to audiences.

The deeper you go, the more youll learn here. Its a loop & often in the teaching phase of skill development youll hit a new ceiling and become the student again&.

-

Dont feel too junior to teach others btw - your perspective is always valuable and open dialogue is good for all.

Zealot-like conclusivity should be seen as uneducational; learning how to think and understand is better than parroting things

1. Whimsical feel

I dont believe that people like to feel like you spent too much time researching them. A nice nudge of personalization is cool, but too much engineering can feel a little bit manipulative to the person who receives it.

You want a cool, effortless feel imo.

2. Inject warmth

Vibes matter; think of trying to come off in a way that gets a small grin. 

This change in brain chemistry primes someone to read your message through a more favorable lens.

It also just feels nicer.

3. Pattern interrupt

This has kinda fallen out of popularity as a term, but imo its critical.

You need to stand out, and the more ways you can show up as different - generally the better. 

Take risks, test tons of different things, and look for ways to show up for unique reasons versus everyone else who is reaching out to your market 

4. Pre-empt objections

If you know the knee jerk reaction your market will have to what you do, you cannot simply walk into that negative pattern.

You become commoditized as something undesirable.

One way to mitigate this is using language that assumes the negative reaction and frames in the context of it rather than ignoring it.

Hey reader - I know everyone hates getting a message about helping you improve cold email, so instead heres some proof:

{insert social proof}

5. The market is not an obstacle to be overcome, it is the heartbeat to your business

Its obvious from the outside who is here to serve and who is here to take. 

Buyers have the power and if you arent willing to serve them you dont even deserve to win in the first place

urn:li:activity:7204261476163883011,"Heres one of the most present yet least talked about factors in outbound sales services.

Risk ownership 

Whether a founder does something themself, hires a team to do it, or hires a third party business - heres the pillars of any business function 

1. The administration of it. Aka the operations. Doing the thing, measuring the thing, managing the people, etc.

In outbound this is the person doing the activities; I.e. calls, socials, emails, mailing stuff&. All of it

2. The cost of it. Funding. Where do the dollars come from?

In theory this is the measurement against the value of point 1 (unless youre reading this post and about to see the most important piece).

Most services are agreeable at face value (I.e. you would pay x to get y if you believed y was actually likely to happen).

How often does y happen? How many outbounders hit quota? It depends& heres why:

3. The risk. Aka who loses if the outcome they believe can happen doesnt happen.

Mission. Critical.

I learned this concept first as an AE selling a specific outsourcing model where the risk aspect was a big deal. 

For outbound, the risk means an SDR doing all the right things gets fired if it ends up that the product they sell isnt desirable by the market. 

Some growth agencies only charge if they set a call, which is a big benefit to companies hiring them since it contains the cost if things dont pan out (which is reality for many of these engagements).

The issue is that in order to offer that concession, the way they operate often changes as well. Their incentive is to chase these trigger event outcomes more than to help you build a successful business.

The idea that value can only be provided by outreach that immediately returns ROI is silly, since its also a way to test viability and de-risk scaled investments 

Heres why:

1. It helps contain your costs to experiment

2. You get to work with someone whos incentivized to run quality tests vs hack for outcomes

3. You can build a foundational understanding of what your market cares about before making your next move 

4. It focuses on understanding your market and matching what they care about vs squeezing immediate outcomes 

Play the long game, only invest in outbound when you understand the risk 

It rarely works out to offload the burden of your company working out to a low cost service provider 

Its an uphill effort either way - take the time to do it intelligently

This is one of the first things I discuss with clients who have narrow target markets & are struggling to make much traction

Admittedly, it forfeits revenue driving opportunities in the transactional / commercialized sense for something I consider more valuable&

Message market fit, which I think of as independent of product & based on what ideas frictionlessly entice our market to talk with us

Having a good product that no one wants to hear about at face value makes outbound impossible

You need to understand what ideas resonate with ice cold audiences, so out of context, that they engage with you anyways

Oftentimes the BUYER of our core solution is some sort of senior person, but the impact of the thing you solve ripples throughout their department

These people in their teams need help too! But they lack budget, and very few products are viably targeted at them

This is a RIPE opportunity to develop micro products / lead magnets that would POTENTLY support these people in their roles

If you show deep problem intimacy, and the ability to provide needle-moving impact via products you develop - even if theyre at no cost and a different medium than your core solution 

(I.e. its ok to make a free service even if your core product is software or visa versa& just focus on what frictionlessly solves your markets needs)

Again - this is where you go if youre struggling to gain traction higher up in the organization& (Im not saying winning = reaching out to irrelevant contacts)& 

What this does for you is:

1. Opens the door into more accounts via expanding the # of people who can say yes by removing financial barrier to becoming a user. This is common in saas, less in services& idk why&

2. Lets you test resonance with contacts below your ultimate decision maker aka not torch your market cluelessly spamming irrelevant stuff

3. Allows you to prove your skin in the game by not only offering paid solutions. This is an ethos thing& companies willing to spend effort to truly serve (free things for non paying users) will have an easier time explaining why theyre worth trusting financially than those who paywall 100% of their usefulness 

4. Gains momentum in learnings, hopefully to apply and adapt to opening your core market again. Over time you sunset efforts here or remove fulfilment burden so it runs on autopilot and becomes a perennial lead getter. This is sorta like Seo re: traffic but organic based on product utility 

5. Credibility with your target decision makers. Serving their team up front for free and no definite benefit in return is a major trust builder. Its also just cool energy - Id rather use email to expand impact than snipe 3% buyers& they both happen at once if done right

(In most cases)

Reasons:

1. Only 10-20% of your market behaviorally answers the phone so you immediately remove 80-90% of possible contacts from being reachable (source: founder of well known phone validation service who I asked directly what % of numbers return as validated through 5 calls)

2. The things that convert on a call have to do with human connection / warmth more than logical argument; youll get false positives off a good caller 

3. Phones are less scalable; what caller A can do is less indicative of what caller b can do than doubling email sends 

4. Phones are less consistent - each repetition is different with unique paths so it can be apples to bananas measuring call to call at times 

With email you can control the inputs more so that the outcomes you receive can be attributed a little more clearly.

Having run hundreds of these, I believe you really do learn more (especially early on) using email.

Calling is the fastest feedback loop, most direct, most immediate& its great for taking the learnings from above & committing to connecting with the people you wish to serve

The work to be done is to segment the market, note every possible persona you may want to talk to, write down all the reasons they may be open to talking with you, and test them rigorously.

The writing, data, infrastructure, etc has mostly been figured out.  

If you're not controlling for deliverability you should work with someone who can help you or read Smartlead's genuinely awesome 90-something page guide on it.

The things you control and should play with most are:

- Audience (who you send to)

- Angle (your reasoning for why they may be interested to talk)

- Offer (the transaction you're asking them to accept - they give x and you give y)

The market will tell you whether you're onto something or not.

Doing outbound well, early on especially, means running those feedback loops & zeroing in on resonance.

Silence (no replies) is acutely painful but also loudly commands attention that you have work to do before ""scaling"" and that sometimes the market fit you've felt via early adopter friends / intros may not be representative of the broader market's attitude.

Seeking TRUTH (only attained via the act of doing outbound) expedites how quickly you get to operate off of clarity re: market resonance.

Only the truth here is scalable.

Step 1: find what works

Step 2: hire people who can repeat what works

There are great w2 employees who could do this, and there are companies like mine that specialize in it.

Heard this on a podcast years ago as a young w2 seller in a pre-PMF company tasked w landing paid pilots for a product that wasn't even built yet.

Stuck with me.

Over time it's become clearer why; values are antifragile to disorder.

When things go sideways, as they inevitably will in life, people want somweone they feel like they can trust to make the next move.

Scarce thinking = the market is saturated with providers

Abundant thinking = the market is begging for potently useful suppliers

There is a ton of money that circulates no matter the market; understanding the forces behind it, the stories, the players, the motivations & the goals...

Makes getting your share a lot easier.

Face value you'd think things are as simple as ""solve for x and get y""

But reality is more complex. Buyers are no more of a commodity than solutions are; if you box the market in too much then you'll receive the same.

urn:li:activity:7191494899811115008,"A common mistake people make with outbound campaigns is moving the goalposts vs actually doing iterations against any given target.

If a company hasn't seen desirable results before, then the ""peak"" of what is achievable is not known (yet).

We generally could all agree that the next campaign we run (segmented audience, validated list, clear & concise copy, specific offer) is merely a starting point to adapt off of.

To make this tangible, imagine The Deal Lab can work with 3 main markets: 

1. Startups building 1st time outbound motions to define & validate ICP-specific messaging at scale done completely for them

2. Founder-led businesses (agency, SaaS, consulting, manufacturing) wanting to define a repeatable process to embed into a team-led motion in the future 

3. Companies with existing sales teams who want us to R&D what repeatable looks like to embed back into their business

If inside each of these I could serve 3 core personas

1. Founders (wants higher revenue & to remove themself from sales seat in org chart to be able to sell business or grow)

2. Marketing Leader (responsible for pipeline, wants to give more to sales)

3. Sales Leader (responsible for sales quota, wants to de-risk target attainment)

If the first campaigns I run is to target Founders of all 3 markets, and I run that for a month with minimal results, IT DOES NOT mean those personas are not effective.

To conclusively say that, you'd need to run a few iterations (different offers, varying levels of weight of your ask, etc).

Many companies miss here by moving to the next thing vs giving the current thing time.

If you zoom out and ask ""is this market + persona the one that I should absolutely positively be able to talk with if my company is to be successful?"" and the answer is YES then you NEED to take the negative feedback (lack of responsiveness) as a BLESSING because it tells you that if you don't change something you're doomed

It's often cope to seek the next easy transactional win vs bite down on the mouthguard and make meaningful product or offer changes to align better to what the market needs or wants.

The market is not a hurdle to overcome; it is the beating heart of your companies existence.

Companies who will spend a little more time and effort figuring out how to align to the market deserve to win more. They care more.

Don't jump too frequently from thing to thing aka shiny object syndrome - commit to markets worth serving & iterate within them until you find something that aligns well.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7191494899811115008,,1 year ago,kellen-casebeer,ACoAABusnpABTh_8asVVMbMZKoJGP6RK238_MTA,Kellen,Casebeer,Helping companies find Message-Market-Fit | Founder @ The Deal Lab | Smartlead Certified Partner | Clay Certified Expert,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQGLoHpREQ6ivQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1672696747667?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=AIi72wDQ8Z6nYybZdmj_qK1DZQxJ3AeDD6LxQVUMLF8,,,,,,True,No,No,No

Its why didnt the thing we thought would work pan out?

Youll learn more from analyzing what landmines exist in your strategy than conceptualizing more potential net new ideas

- phrasing that is unreliable to the markets native way of saying things

- falling into existing patterns 

- failing to preempt obvious objections in your messaging

- failing to ask if that given channel is somewhere your market spends time

- failing to consider your actual offer and whether it is compelling (if you simply rely on the outcome of doing business as your only value then its gonna be tough)

- repeating the same mistakes without learning

Speed to value, iteration cycle length, rate of learning, and willingness to adapt things all play a huge part in success

How you draw it up < how you execute over time

On a 12 month horizon outbound can be ROI positive for everyone, on a 6 month horizon for some, on a 3 month horizon few, and if you need it next month then good luck (gonna cost ya!)

As a seller I took for granted ""product"".

In theory this meant ""what I sold"" and I'd learn an elevator pitch to talk about it.

But the first time I build a consulting product, I was exposed to the concept of SOWs and defining deliverables as a service provider.

At face value it defines what you sell; the deeper truth is it protects you & clients from misalignment (or worse).

Translating market desires to actionable deliverables is how you grease the groove for growing revenue. It makes you easy to say yes to.

The first thing I ask new entrepreneurs is to show me their SOW; when they inevitably don't have one I make fun of them for hating making money.

If you don't have something a prospective customer can say ""yes"" to, you're making it harder than it needs to be to become a customer.

You're also missing out on developing problem intimacy

There's 5,000,003,483,478 different ways (just counted) one could define the statement of work for ""Done for you outbound cold email"" believe it or not.... the better you define yours the less you'll feel the need to ""compete"" with other people's products.

Example: Precision vs Recall

Aka do you want ALL of the right stuff at the cost of including some of the wrong things too (Recall), or do you want to make sure there are NO false positives at the cost of missing some true positives (Precision)
 
Gold mining with pans is an example of high recall low precision; you sift through many times more grains of sand and dirt vs the gold you find

For outbound selling, I tend to lean high precision (thank you Ocean.io for making this easy peasy... i love you). At the minimum, I build high precision lists and de-dupe larger recall lists against them.

If you have proprietary information about someone before you write your message to them, it will almost always improve your outcomes

9 out of 10 sales reps doing outbound is operating off of incredibly LOW precision lists that forces a rounding out of the uniqueness that elite messaging relies on to compel.

What you can sell via inbound traffic is often a distraction from what it would take to win via outbound 

If your attitude is that investing in a new revenue channel (as a means of De-risking current ones or saving a sinking ship) is that it has 45 days to prove itself or its not worth it - you genuinely shouldnt even start

Its not sincere

Go out and map your markets, their segments, the personas in the segments, each pain point you address of theirs, how your product maps to those pains&

Now choose a channel (or a couple, being mindful that 5x channels =\= 5x rate of learning)

Run tests controlling for a specific offer to a specific pain of a specific person inside a specific segment of a specific market. You can go further like assessing language via aggregate job listings to extrapolate organizational priorities (but thats advanced stuff that few can pull off, especially if youre just reading this post)

By running these tests, you can conclusively categorize each funnel as worth continuing to invest in and iterate or not. It becomes clear whether this will work easily vs can work with effort vs likely wont work.

Remember though, the more nodes you map out (market - segment - persona - pain), the more campaigns youll need to run to conclusively decide if a persona or market is not worth pursuing.

The prior year I'd been building embedded outbound teams as a consultant - I'd seen just about every problem that a company standing up an outbound function could see - and knew we could better serve this audience

As a consultant the feedback loop of coaching new ideas, testing them, and iterating to success was often too slow for the cost clients paid - we were constrained by my time and their reps' ability to apply our ideas.

For a fraction of the cost, I knew I could do 10x the volume at 10x the quality and produce 10x the rate of learning - IF I had a way of just doing the outbound myself. 

Enter Smartlead, introduced to me by Jesse Ouellette & built by Vaibhav Namburi.

With Smartlead I was able to ""scale"" myself across clients; so it immediately became the building block of our business. My process + the infrastructure smartlead allows us to operate through = big value for clients at a fraction of the cost.

In the ~year since, many hundreds of meetings across a few dozens clients have been booked 100% through smartlead.

I'm incredibly proud to announce we've been selected as one of the 25 Certified Smartlead Partners (out of hundreds of applicants).

This means we'll continue to collaborate with the best in the business, share our learnings in public, and push the bar of what is capable via cold outbound.

It's a dream to do this & moments of external validation like this are a rare moment as a business owner where I can pick my head up and soak in the experience.

Gimme 25 min or so & I'll be back to obsessively driving client results though...

Get a coach, a friend, a pod, set aside your own time, do something - anything - to make sure youre learning & getting feedback from others outside your companys little sales monoculture though

Early career reps may not realize how much breadth there is in roles out there, and how much their outcomes are reliant on uncontrollables determined by the company (the market you target, what your product does, what youre told that market allegedly cares about)

I spent 3 years spinning my wheels as a rep trying to do what my companies told me

Everything got better the moment I branched out from that

urn:li:activity:7148113833490796544,"This is a truth you dont feel as an employee like you do as an owner

Getting customers is the easy part

Keeping them happy is significantly harder

As a rep I cared about my clients and Id go to bat for them any day of the week

As an owner?

Its more like constant mild nausea that whose single cure is positive client outcomes

The only thing Ive experience that comes even slightly close to this was the early days of pregnancy before my son was born & before we could tell anyone because theres a risk it wont pan out 

I prayed every night - please God just let this sweet innocent child grow healthily& Ill do anything&

Owning a business feels like that, except theres no God for positive b2b sales outcomes - theres just Kellen, my partner Barrett, and our will to succeed

And because this is the core of our dna, we have to be incredibly careful with who we take on as a client

I used to sell a fraction of all that we do for current clients at 2.5x the price

The value Ive packed into my services is the kind of thing that will break us if I cant keep clients happy

Were not built for churn

We wont misrepresent outcomes 

Theres no magic wand

We need to be so careful with client selection that I literally end up doing half the work for free up front just in case theyre not the right person to do business with

If I turned on even half the ways weve built for acquiring customers wed cripple ourselves overnight - the nuclear options are reserved exclusively for paying clients with delivery teams capable of handling the exhaust of what we build them

Growth is cool, but I enjoy being methodical in these early days as I fine tune by hand these beautiful artisanal revenue engines

I feel like Brunello Cucinelli, or a fine winemaker, or a poet when Im at work& its my craft & Im proud to share it

I dont want to be Henry ford (assembly-line, mass produced) I want to be Akira Nakai {image below a sample of his beautiful art} (hand crafted, not for all, each output its own unique piece of art) 

I had to shrink my calendar availability before making this (just in case), but am going to be a little more public with what weve built and do at the deal lab this year

- Double check that value props are persona dependent (not title) i.e. Founder of market A (Seed stage SaaS) vs Market B (SEO Agency) are different personas

- Write out all value props for each persona and play ""keep, kill or combine"". Also play with the ""angle"" of each value prop aka how you frame the idea itself dialing in the level of specificity, professionalism, esotericism, and creativity used to convey the same general ideas

- If you're getting little responses / engagement try calling the reps of companies who sell into the same market for tips

urn:li:activity:7123750520921456640,"10 Million Years of Apex Predatory Evolution & What Sellers Can Learn From Cats:

I used to rent a room out to a woman named Cali who adopted a cat halfway through her lease.

Shed play with it using these fluffy toys attached to a string on the end of a stick. The cat would bat at the ball of fluff, and the woman would move the stick around to rile up Hobbes.

One day I observed Hobbes stalking one of these toys while Cali was showering. He was crouched down low, paw in the air& shaking slightly.

Hobbes slowed his movement, the shaking increased, and then he pounced on the toy.

It caught my attention so I hopped onto ChatGPT and asked it why the cat had shook.

What did I Learn?

Cats are hunters.

We know this.

What you, like I, probably didnt know is how that has two competing effects on cats; whether it be Lions in the jungle or Hobbes in my guest bedroom.

Cats shake because they have two competing signals firing in their brains at once.

The first signal is their instinctual brain - they are hard wired via millions of years of evolution to KILL.

Pounce!

Attack!

Theyre vicious, hunting, killing machines down to their core & every bit of their ancestral instinct is to GO. NOW.

The willingness, intensity, and absoluteness in the decision to pounce is critical in the wild when the smallest of % of margin can be the difference between a successful kill or being hunted down ones self.

Literal life or death.

Natures heavy like that, and it makes me glad that Im sitting here in my home office listening to the Grateful Dead acoustic sets writing this little story.
Anyways - back to brain signals&

The second signal is a cats logical brain.

Despite all that programming mentioned above, a cat still knows that by waiting it can increase the likelihood of success when it pounces.

The shaking is a cat doing its best to withhold against its nature in order to increase the likelihood that it succeeds in its ultimate goal.

Feel familiar?

Sellers have the exact same instinct to pounce

Its just that we pounce on prospects questions and jump at the opportunity to unload on them with a barrage of features, benefits, strategies, insights and value.

We tell them EVERYthing.

We LOVE to.

Were a natural right? We are problem solvers&

Except we commit a cardinal sin & fail to dig deeper.

Rather than start pitching - the deeper we can sit back, ask probing questions, and dig into the words of our prospect - we increase the likelihood of our own success.

We need to retool our algorithm as sellers, and understand that the more we hold off and learn, the easier it will be when we decide to pounce.

Start today.

Now.

Have a client who is an outsourced {classified} shop.

One target we're testing currently is reaching out to MSPs to see if their clients ever ask for what we do (complimentary service). We'll offer a case study up of another MSP who we work with that resells our offer as an additional revenue stream.

Here's how we built it... 

Step 1: Went to Clutch (review site), created a filtered search based on MSP type, area of focus, headcount and minimum deal size.

Step 2: Run instant data scraper chrome extension against it - BOOM 6200 companies

Step 3: Clean up the csv in sheets; I always keep one untouched version, copy that, and mess with the new one. Here I took out only the 10-49 headcount MSPs as an initial target.

Step 4: Upload CSV company list of 10-49 headcount ((aprox 2500 orgs)) to Apollo(dot)io so I haved the saved company list

Step 5: Download the apollo version of the csv with the added enrichment info, including a cleaner list of org names and the domain they use ((my initial list linked to services pages and wasn't just main root domain))

Step 6: Copy the column of domains and use it on the ""Search People"" tab under the ""company"" -> ""include list of companies"" tab on apollo

Step 7: Now that the search is of people, it's essentially all employees of all these orgs... MESSY -> so we filter out 2 different key personas

CEOs // Founders and also VPs of Sales // CROs

Step 8: Use Clay to call out the # of reviews from clutch and the average across them paired with verified contact data from apollo ran against neverbounce to make sure we only send to live domains.

Step 9: Load the campaign, contact data and my client's freshly warmed domains into smartlead and hit send

Step 10: text my mom, tell her i love her, and handle the inflow of excited prospects getting 1:1 messages even though this campaign has like 1200 targets

A well known sales rep recently shared an email made similarly ((worse imo - but im biased)) that excited them despite being clearly ""automated"" ((I prefer the term engineered)).

Theres a bunch of trendy buzzwords like grit, adaptability, etc that could be cast to characterize my friend here - but they all fall short in capturing who this man really is

Not often you can find someone who simultaneously holds themself to such a high standard but also operates with humility & care

Whether its a leadership role, account manager or partnerships - good things will happen for your business when Jack is on your team

Hes probably the #1 person I wish I had a way to get to come be on my team, and its why I am happy to recommend him to anyone out there looking for sales talent

And it worked well for me, but when I tried to replicate it among team members, I learned that what we do is just completely different from a classic mid-sized B2B SaaS sales process.

For any organisation selling larger deal sizes or complex offerings, you should really take a look at the ""Consultative Selling Playbook""!

If you're leading or enabling sales teams, you've probably seen this:

L Sellers jumping straight to pitching features
L Deals stalling because buyers dont see business value
L Sales reps struggling with multi-stakeholder complexity

Sound familiar?

So we built a full guide for the Consultative Selling Framework  and now were giving it away.

=Ø Whats inside this playbook? Its 15 pages of proven methodology built by our sales expert Michael Pierce, former VP of Sales at Toqio and ex-Mambu sales leader, where he helped scale revenue from $1M to $40M+ ARR.

Its designed to help your team:

 Shift from pitching to problem-solving
 Structure deals around business outcomes, not just features
 Run discovery conversations like strategic advisors
 Handle complex buying committees with confidence
 Build lasting partnerships, not just closed deals

 It even includes:

¡ Our full 6-stage Consultative Selling Framework
¡ Coaching tips for each step

¡ Real B2B examples
¡ Implementation roadmap for your sales org

Why it works:
=9 It aligns sales with how modern B2B buyers buy

Brame - a MarTech company specializing in gamification marketing - had massive clients and top retailers under their belt.

But growth wasnt just about getting more deals.

The real challenge?

Scaling in a structured, repeatable way.

Most companies try to scale without:

L Clear milestones
L Defined expectations for customers
L A repeatable growth framework for client expansion

And thats where things break.

So, what did Brame do differently?

 Milestone-Driven Growth with clients
They didnt just set goals. They followed a structured plan with their clients - one step at a time.

 Client Expectation Management at Scale
A service catalog now ensures clients know exactly what to expect and what to buy if they want more.

No surprises. No misalignment. Just execution.
 A Strategic Growth Plan to expand every single client

A system that allows them to scale inside their customers - unlocking new revenue from existing relationships.

The result?

=9 Predictable growth
=9 Fewer roadblocks
=9 More sales, less friction

Growing fast is easy.

Growing right is what actually scales.

They were able to achieve all of this with the support of our Program Expert Linus =€ Haferkemper. Linus is well-versed in scaling Customer Success teams and driving SaaS growth, guiding B2B clients through digital transformation.

They got to us cause they wanted to increase their lead generation.

This is exactly what we focused on: building an AI-Lead Gen System.

With their very first campaign, they already closed 20k and made their ROI.

And numbers are increasing now...

While this was a great result, what really stunned me was the following:

During the time they built the system with our experts, they also made the best out of the entire platform and enablement-programs we offer.

Next to building the AI-Lead Gen System, they also did an entire Hubspot CRM Setup by themselves, leveraging our eLearning and templates.

Usually, you spend 20-30k for this with an agency - They did it themselves!

When I hear such things, I get so excited, seeing how clients make the best out of what we offer, and sometimes even more.

Instead of spending 50k for an agency, they spent 20k, got the money back in no time, and trained themselves to continue doing all of this without spending further money.

That might still work for markets with clear problems, small deal sizes, and big volumes.

Complex solutions and deal sizes >50k are mainly bought based on:

The gang is growing and more than 30 AI/Clay/RevOps enthusiasts joined.

Within the ongoing discussions, one interesting question came up:

WILL WE ALL RECEIVE EVEN MORE SPAM IN THE FUTURE? >/

My answer:

No. It will be the opposite.

Why?

While Email servers are gearing up to include AI in their spam filtering, more and more emails end up in spam directly.

That means, doing outbound emailing in a non-professional fashion becomes less and less effective.

More emails end up in spam, so we get less annoyed, and because of that, more people will stop doing it.

Only true experts will know how to build a truly effective professional system.

And these systems are highly targeted and trigger-based.

Meaning, sending fewer emails and less spam, but more value.

Thats just my opinion; getting there might take a while.

But wondering what other experts think on that matter?

We used to do the same.

But what we did with 10 sales reps in the past can now be done with 2 SDRs + SDR-Agents.

Saves you tons of money, and gets the job done even better.

>à What is an SDR-Agent?

SDR-Agent is a term we at Peakora started to use to describe fully automated workflows that identify an intent signal from a potential buyer, enrich the data, and directly send a personalised and relevant message over email and/or LinkedIn to the person.

Here's what our ""Newly funded"" SDR-Agent does:

 Finds newly funded companies the moment they raise money
 Pushes data to Clay, where data is filtered and deduped
 Enriches data of CEO/CSOs and all other insights needed
 Writes a personal message with our specific offering to this person
 Synces data to Hubspot and sends messages by Email

This process converts at 12% and books us valuable calls with C-Level of startups & scaleups that fit our ICP.

All on autopilot, fully automated.

Why is it working so well?

=9 Timing: Highly relevant to their current situation
=9 Valuable: We offer something of true value to their current situation
=9 Personalised: We show that we know their exact situation and can help

SDR-Agent is a term we at Peakora started using to describe fully automated workflows that identify an intent signal from a potential buyer, enrich the data, and directly send a personalised and relevant message over email and/or LinkedIn to the person.

The Agents are very powerful because:

 They act on a real-time signal which increases conversion
 Are personalized, and reach the buyer at the right moment
 Increase efficiency by automating the work SDRs did manually before
 Let you scale, by being fully automated and integrated with your CRM

The possibilities are endless, and for any signal that can be measured and is relevant to the buyer and your offering, you can build such an Agent.

Today, we share the playbook for 3 SDR-Agents with you that any company can use:

1ã Engage when a client champion changes to a new company
2ã Engage when a target account makes a new buyer persona hire
3ã Engage when a target account posts a job role indicating a need
  
The Results?

Approximately 10% of businesses manage to surpass 1M in yearly revenues.

Only 1% manage to reach 10M.

Why is that?

Because at this stage, everything changes.

With hard hustle, we can get to 1M. Sometimes even alone or with a team of 2-3 people.

But the people who hustle hard are not always the ones who can also scale.

And the characteristic that enabled them to get to 1M is sometimes even what limits them to go to 10M - hustling hard, instead of building a business.

I've been there and made the same mistake.

So do many of our clients.

Heres the hard truth:

¡ Your company wont scale because of heroic fixes or gut instincts.
¡ Scaling is all about resource allocation.

As a founder, your focus shifts to:

¡ Where to allocate limited resources.
¡ Who to place in the right roles to scale.
¡ How to move from gut-feel decisions to data-driven strategies.

And heres where it gets critical: Data is your new best friend.

¡ Acquisition data shows you whats working (and whats not).
¡ Individual performance data uncovers sales and marketing efficiency.
¡ Resource tracking ensures every dollar and hire is well spent.

This isnt about micromanaging. Its about creating a scalable system.

Right roles, right tools, and the right decisions supported by data.

Once you nail this, growth becomes scalable and predictable, not plain hustle.

urn:li:ugcPost:7289934003401355264,"""We struggle to transition from founder-led to sales organization""

I hear this all the time from our clients.

Heres what I tell them:

""Everyone with a driver's license can drive a car.""

""But your company is not a car, it's a custom-built cyber truck that most often only the people who built it know how to operate.""

¡ You can't expect anyone to drive this successfully if not even yourself has figured it out yet and without a clear manual on how to operate it.

So here's how we approach this with our clients:

PART 1 - Conceptionally design the correct sales process:

1ã Define your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP): Industry, size, pain points, etc.
2ã Clarify your deal size
3ã Tailor your process to your deal size: Process for $10K deals ` $100K.
4ã Map the process with Lifecycle Stages and pipeline stages

PART 2 - Operationalise the process in your CRM and train the people on it

1ã Implement the process & pipeline in your CRM
2ã Install acceptance criteria for each stage (required fields)
3ã Build snippets and templates for each stage and calls to have
4ã Record training material to onboard new reps within weeks

A good CRM isnt just a data storage tool.

It supports every action, adding value as it gathers information.

When you map these steps into your CRM, heres what happens:

’ Sales can replicate similar results as the founders did
’ Sales loves working with the CRM because it gives them time back
’ New hires ramp up within weeks
’ Predictable, scalable revenue becomes a reality.

$8.71 ROI for every $1 spent on CRM.

Not a typo. Just facts.

But it doesnt stop there.

The next Step is to build a sales cockpit to track everything.

Thats how you grow beyond the startup phase.

For now, focus on one thing:

Installing the correct process!

Whats your biggest process gap?

And with Linus =€ Haferkemper, we have someone who went from 10 to 70M in ARR at Dropbox and built a CS Team of 20 people.

Together, we built the most holistic CS offering in the DACH market.

But then, VERY FEW truly cared!?

Why? Because everyone was still obsessed with sales.

People only see top-of-funnel growth, not retention.

The big mistake?

Forgetting that retention is the real driver of growth:

When you acquire a client, the first purchase is often less than 50% of the lifetime value you can unlock from them.

One of our clients even unlocked 5x lifetime value from each new customer by focusing on retention.

So, what should you be doing instead?

1ã Focus on your existing customers.
2ã When things get tough, your current customers are your best bet.
3ã Theyre already sold on you. Its easier to keep them than constantly chase new ones.

Build a Customer Success framework from day one:

¡ Its not about waiting for upsells.
¡ Start with solid onboarding.
¡ Set clear goals early on and track metrics to ensure success.

Retention isnt an afterthoughtits the foundation.

urn:li:activity:7272229830652215298,"How we achieved a 50% profit increase during a market downturn in 2024:

There are 3 main factors that impact the success of your business:

1ã Your marketing and sales skills
2ã Your offering
3ã Your market

So when in 2023, the global startup crisis started, our market dropped.

We started improving everything we could:

1ã Our marketing, sales, and upselling process.
2ã Our offering, and client delivery.

The result?

It was still a f**** struggle, and I definitely did not have the energy to do that another year.

My learning: The 3 factors above are true, but the level of impact on your business is exactly the opposite:

1ã Your market has the biggest impact on the success of your business
2ã Second, your Offering
3ã Third, your marketing and sales skills

And that's a reason why you sometimes see really good entrepreneurs failing and barely mediocre once thriving.

Early 2024 I finally learned that lesson, and we included IT-SMBs in our ICP focus and started tailoring our offering also for them.

The result?

¡ A new market that actually has money.

¡ Pouring this traction into a sales and delivery engine that was a master piece after polishing it for a year.

¡ 50% increase in profitability.

>à Conclusion?

1. If your cake runs out of money, don't fight for the last piece, search another one.
2. Money can be made by focusing on productivity, and not just new clients.
3. I waited too long.

Who can relate?

A company with 3 salespeople wastes over CHF 50K yearly on manual lead research.

CHF 70/h internal rate x 1 hour daily x 5 days weekly x 48 weeks x 3 sales people = CHF 50,400 wasted.

While we often talk about scaling and improving our acquisition, we often neglect the immense cost reductions and productivity wins that can be gained.

And I'm not talking just about SMB's here, also startups and scaleups often still do this:

L Manually look up people and try to find the email
L Sending manually written emails
L Buy shady lead lists
L Paying for database access
L or trying to have agencies do the work for them

Those companies end up spending in total 100k and more per year
(for people & tools), and still face these challenges:

=+ Manual work consumes time and energy.
=É Low reply rates waste your effort.
L Data chaos that leads to duplication and errors.
=°=% Costs add up fast with low ROI.

Here is what they should do instead:

Have a centralised person/team to:

1ã Build account lists with SalesNavigator or other online databases based on ICP criteria and/or intend signals

2ã Use Phantombuster or other web scraper tools to export the lists into Clay

3ã Program a Clay table to enrich the account and contact data in the exact format you need it

4ã Use OpenAI to write completely personalised and relevant messaging

5ã Provide the data to the sales team by importing the data to your CRM in real-time

6ã Send fully automated and personalised campaigns by Email and Linkedin with SmartLead and Heyreach

Total cost? Less than CHF 500.-- per month for tools and data.

The outcome:

 Save 50k of manual time wasted
 Congruent high-quality data, messaging, and outreach because it's steered through a centralised unit
 Meeting Booking rates of 5-20% depending on your deal size, market, and conversion strategy

In our tactics.

In our daily tasks.

Here are the top 3 mistakes we see after working with 120+ businesses:

1ã Chasing every opportunity.

We see potential everywhere and try to grab it all.

Before we realise, we are spread thin and do not make any progress anywhere anymore.


2ã Not putting a long term strategic target

If we try to be everything for everyone, we end up being nothing for no one.

In our marketing, in our sales, and with our offering.

3ã Not storing their learnings

We do wild firefighting trying to solve a problem, instead of systematic testing to single out what works and what not.

These mistakes are a recipe for failure and burnout, not for sustainable growth.

1ã Define a clear beach head

urn:li:activity:7267102612271808512,"The AI Lead Gen Myth: With Clay and AI everything will change.

Heres the hard truth: No tech stack can save a bad strategy and offering.

Yes, Clay and AI will help you to substantially save time and build better and personalised copy at scale.

But if your offering is poor and your CTA has no true value, it won't help.

To build a scalable AI Lead Gen system, consider these principle:

=¡ Conversion strategies vary widely by deal size:

--> Smaller deals need more automation and volume.
--> Larger deals demand more exclusive and tailored value.

Heres how we break it down:

1ã Low touch (ACV <$10k): Focus on awareness, lightweight content, and community resources for volume.

2ã Mid touch (ACV $10-100k): Use trigger-based outreach, free resources, and focused follow-ups to engage leads.

3ã High touch (ACV >$100k): Prioritise personalisation, and highly exclusive offerings for decision-makers.

We recently applied these principles with a client, using our Go-To-Market Matrix:

=° Deal sizes: mostly $100k+
ð Sales cycle: 3-6 months
<â Multi-stakeholder decision process

This meant long buying processes and multiple decision-makers.

After analyzing their needs and sales cycle, we explored a few options:

<‰ Event-based outreach  Engaging leads before industry events to arrange warm introductions and meetings.

=Ý Lead magnet  Offering a high-value assessment or resource to initiate engagement.

=Q Exclusive event  Hosting a tailored, invite-only experience for a specific buyer persona.

We chose the exclusive event approach for its ability to create trust and personal investment.

Why the exclusive event worked so well:

1ã Delivered upfront value  We offered meaningful insights before the event, creating anticipation and value.

2ã Drove individual engagement  Pre-event conversations allowed participants to share insights, building rapport early on.

3ã Matched the long sales cycle  The exclusive format provided multiple touchpoints, ideal for a 3-6 month cycle.

The result?

In 2 months:

=Þ 150+ Calls
=È +1.5M in pipeline deal value
=° 30% avg Opp to Closed won CVR

Our client wanted to reach C-level executives in Switzerland's financial sector.

But they faced a major obstacle - these CEOs are notoriously hard to engage.

We suggested they focus on deep personalization and value-driven messaging.

1ã It cuts through the noise in a crowded inbox
2ã It demonstrates genuine understanding of their needs
3ã It provides immediate value, increasing response likelihood

Here's what we did next:

1ã Built a comprehensive target list using advanced scraping tools
2ã Enriched contact data with Clay.com for deeper insights
3ã Developed messaging that spoke directly to each CEO's pain points and offered something of exclusive value

The result?

A 6% meeting booking rate - 6x higher than the industry standard=€

Remember, in high-stakes outreach, quality always trumps quantity.

Your conversion strategy must be aligned with your deal sizes. Higher deal sizes = more value and exclusivity is needed to make people convert.

urn:li:ugcPost:7234474431241240576,"Why do so many startups have chaos when it comes to structure, leadership, and planning? =Ê

It really stuns me, how sometimes organisations with multiple million revenues have almost zero structure in their planning and hence leading their teams.

Especially, as there are simple and battleproven frameworks to follow that are used by many high-growth companies, giving clear directions and more time back to the management team.

Find here the framework we used at Beekeeper and what we teach our clients:

1ã Annual company OKR meeting:
Translate your long-term strategy and financial goals into tangible operational objectives with clear metrics to reach (management level).

2ã Quarterly team planning meeting:
Break down the yearly goals into quarterly objectives and metrics to reach. Each team needs to think about how they can contribute and get clear objectives and metrics they own. (team level).

3ã Weekly check-ins:
Every week the team checks in, updates the progress on their KPIs and defined the top 3 prios for the week. Work with traffic lights, as long as things are on track, you don't ask questions. Management only focuses on what's off track and hence ensures their energy goes into what matters.


4ã Quarterly retrospectives
At the end of each quarter, run a retro session to analyse what worked and what not and define improvements for the coming quarter.

On the following slides, I show examples of what each of these meetings looks like =È=¡ You'll get a glimpse of the topics we cover and the results we achieve.

This was the topic of the webinar I held two weeks ago, organised by Cavalry Ventures and Wille Finance.

In 2017 I built one of the largest Outbound-Sales Engines at Beekeeper. But what AI enables us today is absolutely astonishing.

The work that was done manually by 10 BDRs before can now be done by 1 ""BDR Engineer"", almost fully automated and with way better conversion.

See here how we book meetings while asleep:

1ã RSS Feed triggers whenever a fundraise is announced

2ã Webhook pushed data into Clay

3ã Clay we programmed to give us the necessary company and contact info

4ã Data is pushed into Hubspot CRM and Sales is notified by Slack. Connection request is sent to buyer persona.

5ã Sales clicks one button (can also be automated) and enrols lead in sequence, adding additional customisation if desired.

6ã Lead is reached at the right time with a valuable offering and responds. See results in the slides.

This can be completely customised to the needs of every company.

Based on the data from 100+ DACH Startups collected through our Startup Benchmark 2024 so far, we have identified three key factors influencing yearly account churn:

= 3 Key Factors Influencing Account Churn

1ã Startups that invest time and effort in identifying optimal acquisition channels see significantly lower account churn rates. Many startups fixate on cutting CPS and CPAs and boosting lead numbers. Yet, discovering the perfect acquisition channel proves pivotal for long-term success and sustainable growth.

2ã Your yearly churn rate is heavily influenced by the industry in which you operate in. While not surprising, the extent of variation remains significant.

3ã Effective automation of marketing, sales & customer success processes through your CRM significantly reduces churn rates. Data reveals that higher CRM automation correlates directly with lower churn rates, underscoring its significant impact on enhancing customer retention when implemented professionally.

Hardware startups lead with the longest runway, averaging 30 months left, while SaaS Startups, particularly B2B SaaS startups in Series A and B stages, face significant challenges.

B2B SaaS Series A having an average of 7 months left and Series B only 6 months - highlighting the critical phase of scaling and profitability.

Startups across all stages are adapting, with many focusing on achieving profitability.

Honestly, I don't know. I learned the benefits of both worlds. Nothing beats the extremely vibrant high-energy environment I experienced at Beekeeper.

On the other side, being able to work from Capetown and enabling your employees to fulfil their dreams is also a blessing.

When it comes to Peakora, we're still doing it. And this year something interesting happened:

Last week we had our second management offsite this year, in beautiful Lisbon.

For a full week we worked together and enjoyed the Portuguese sun. But what happened is, that people started organising themselves.

From being fully remote, they all ended up spending 2 months in Lisbon together, enjoying the full-remote lifestyle while actually working together face-to-face.

Zero company involvement, just giving people space to design their lives. Cool, no? We have one life. Let's design it as good as we can =€

""People are not really working at home""

--> Yes, I've sadly seen things like that. But maybe you just hired the wrong people? In our case, I can tell you that we've been working our a***off over the past months to help startups navigate these challenging times.

The startups came from all over the world and InnoQube Switzerland brought them all to an absolute scenic mountain cabin in the Swiss Alps.

The four main mistakes we see over and over again when entering the GTM Stage are:

1ã Not knowing or measuring your Product-Market fit

2ã No clear focus on an Ideal Customer Profile / Niche market

3ã As a logical result: Not having a good message-market fit and low converting channels

4ã Not choosing the correct GTM-Model for your ICP and hence building an unprofitable business from the very start

Wondering how to solve that? Comment ""Slides"" below and make sure you're connected so I can share the slides with you.

However, it's not just about the CRM tool, but also how to set it up! =Ê

And the setup is especially crucial for any company, that plans to transition from founder-led sales to developing a real sales organization.

Or how can you as a founder expect, that other people do the job same good as you if there is not even a process and a tool that guides them...?

<á Let's draw an analogy:

Imagine 10 people living in a Flat and another 10 people living in a Villa. Both homes have no rules and thus, chaos prevails in both homes, no matter the size.

Similarly, your CRM, no matter which tool you use, it becomes inefficient without a proper setup.

To transition to a well-structured sales and marketing organization, we need to replicate what founders have been doing manually. This means defining processes and operationalizing them within your CRM.

Having worked with over 100+ startups over the past three years, we found that many startups are so busy developing their product that they don't even take the time to measure their user engagement.

Instead, they focus on developing the next product feature or just think they need to sell more to cover the churn.

=¡ But measuring user engagement with your product is the ultimate way to prove product-market fit, and develop a product that retains long term:

1ã Track your user engagement from day 0 and watch how many are still there after 14, 21, and more days (or weeks/months)

2ã Find the ""hockey stick"", or the user group that gets closest to it

3ã Segment your data, to understand who these people are

<¯ Converting high-profile buyer personas
<¯ Non-Founder-Led, executable by employees

urn:li:ugcPost:7130473653867016192,"Last Wednesday, I was asked a very pressing question: What do venture capitalists prioritise given the changing fundraising landscape?

Alongside Nikolai Ladanyi, I had the chance to be part of an exciting Scaling How-to-Session, organized by #StartupBerlin, #StartAlliance, and Impact Hub Berlin, all important players of the Berlin startup ecosystem.

During the session, we discussed the essential factors when it comes to scaling impact ideas and shared valuable insights from the industry. Among the key takeaways, one fundamental question came up: What are VCs truly seeking when it comes to fundraising?

Considering the capital shortage, there are two important considerations:

1ã Time to product-market fit: The faster and more efficiently you reach PMF, the earlier you can begin building traction for your product.

2ã Profitability > Market share: In the current landscape, prioritizing profitability over market shares is fundamental. Neglecting profitability in favor of market share can jeopardize the sustainability of your business.

That means the time when startups just throw money at problems is definitely over, and building the right foundations at the right time becomes more and more important to grow in a sustainable and efficient manner.

< NEW: With our Scaling Readiness Assessment we help Startups doing exactly that, and I'm happy to share that Peakora is now also a BAFA-registered company, meaning that German startups can get up to 80% reimbursed for such an Assessment.

5 months ago I shared a picture of our team from Lisbon, talking about this topic which resonated with a lot of you.

Now we just all came together once more for 1 week of teamwork in Berlin, and here's what we newly learned:

< Distance:
Our team is now spread out over Switzerland, Portugal, Sweden, and Germany. But the distance was never a problem, as long as we all worked in the same/similar timezone. By now we are 6 people in the core team + 5 Program Experts.

d Connectivity & Culture:
We're doing this now for 2.5 years. Our culture was mainly built remotely, and personal connections were deepened during team events - worked perfectly.

’ Efficiency:
Being remote-first forces us to have very clear processes and structures and also automate a lot of them. This would most likely never be the case if we were not remote and it creates substantial productivity gains. Our most important tool stack: Notion, Hubspot, Google Suite, Slack - And plenty of integrations and automation.

=° Cost
We save quite some money on rent. But with flying everyone in once a quarter and paying for hotels and activities on the weekends, the cost is about the same.

<à Work from home/isolation:
We all still highly value the freedom and flexibility we have in our lives, but working from home all the time makes me feel sad. Over the summer when we were at least 3 ppl in Zurich, we tried a coworking. It was nice, but 1 month suddenly 2 ppl were on vacation. Still figuring out the best solution here - Tipps are welcome.

We will definitely continue this way while we grow the company and the team. And there is quite something cooking again which we will announce soon =

Stay tuned and thanks for following us on that journey so far =O<ü

urn:li:ugcPost:7112730304330522624,"Major Message-Market fit and Value proposition issues among Seed and Series A companies:

Yesterday, at the Bits & Pretzels roundtables, I had the pleasure of sitting at the table with other marketing experts in DACH.

In this talk, professor and investor Mike de Saldanha as well as marketing expert Nicole Laurence both shared their frustration about the missing marketing foundations in many early-stage companies.

Our recent scaling readiness report also confirmed, that less than 15% of startups have truly understood their own unique selling proposition. 

Why is this so important?

Understanding the value you provide and communicating it effectively can make or break your startup's success.

Your Message-Market fit will ultimately lead to:

 Better targeting and efficiency: knowing your audience inside and out will help you better engage your prospects and increase the effectiveness of your marketing and sales efforts.

 Better positioning: if you know your ideal customer profile and your unique selling proposition, you can develop a stronghold in the market.

 Increased conversion rates: Attracting the right buyers from the beginning also impacts heavily your mid-to-bottom conversion rates as your product fits so nicely to their needs, that competitors are not even considered.

 Improved customer satisfaction and retention: Attracting the right prospects top-of-funnel also leads to higher satisfaction and retention rates down the line. 

Some companies we worked with did 2-4X in revenues over 6 months by applying simple frameworks that solve exactly this challenge =€ More info in the video.

We see many companies struggling exactly with this step, not getting enough returns from the market, to understand where they should set their focus.

While Outbound Emailing is definitely effective for established companies to scale acquisition once PMF and Message-Market fit is defined, it can also serve another purpose if done right:

PHAROS - The Post Group has successfully deployed a comprehensive outbound engine for their product Webgate.io, enabling outreach to 3000+ companies monthly to validate their markets.

Thiago Costas, Head of Growth at Webgate, explains us what they found =u

1ã Discovered new use cases and revealed a significantly larger market for continued prospecting
2ã Garnered extensive qualitative feedback that fed back into their overall marketing strategy
3ã Gained valuable insights into pricing perceptions beyond their core market
validated their value proposition and fine-tuned their messaging
4ã Confirmed the effectiveness of outbound as a proactive approach to initiating conversations with potential clients

To make things work the same way as Thiago did, it's important to establish a structured and systematic approach, as well as a solid outbound engine, and not just some linkedin lead scraping and emailing process.

That's what we hear often - However, I'd say exactly the opposite it true.

In ABM/ABS markets, having a REAL outbound engine is the core of pretty much all campaigns you do.

With REAL I mean, having the capability in-house to produce any kind of highly targeted and customised account and contact data, without being limited by relying on a purchased data base.

That's the core on which then the campaigns are planned, and then the execution of course comes multi-channel, highly personalised and synchronised.

Mark Lechler of 9T Labs revealed to us that he was the biggest naysayer in the company.

So we're even happier that he's now one of the main proponents of the outbound engine they've implemented and doing an amazing job.

For us, this was probably the most shocking finding of our market study.

We see this problem all the time, we call it the ""Product-Founder Fit"".

What it is?
It describes the fact that founders are often so in love with their product that they are convinced that the market will love it too, without actually checking if they have a product that people actually want and need, and (most importantly!) that they can generate revenue and profit with.

Yet it would be so easy to measure PMF. All you need is 1 question.

1. Target Roles
    - Focus on the right roles - e.g., for dev tools, highly technical positions (developers, cloud architects, security engineers)
    - Filter for permanent roles, not contractor positions

2. Strategic Job Board mining
    - LinkedIn Jobs + Indeed + Glassdoor
    - Filter by company size matching your ICP
    - Save searches for ongoing monitoring

3. Tech patterns
    - Scrape them for required skills & technologies
    - Filter for your relevant competitors or integration partners
    - Track changes over time and see how their tech track evolves over time

BONUS: Apply the insights that youve just captured

- Identify decision-maker roles
- Spot migration & upgrade patterns
- Build trigger-based outreach

The key? Job listings are public, updated regularly, and need to list the tech stack, so they can attract the right candidate for the job.

Traditional warmup is limited, detectable, and not realistic (and Gmail knows it).

The more real signals you send, the more Google and Outlook trust you. 

Now with Maildoso's AI agents, you can genuinely initiate browser sessions that look and feel like a real user, not a bot.

What you get:

1. Real-browser sessions
    
AI logs into Gmail/Outlook, opens emails, replies, moves messageseven un-spamsall on natural timing.
    
2. Massive, stackable volume
    
Add 25100 warm-up sends per day on top of Instantly or Smartlead for 130+ human-like touches per mailbox.
    
3. Faster recovery & super affordable

Burned domains heal in 24 weeks (not months), and youll land 98 %+ of emails in the inboxall for $2/mailbox/month.
    

If youre not getting enough responses or youre running outbound for a while with little or no success, use Maildosos AI agents for 14 days, then ramp your cold sends without worrying about spam.

1. Deep market understanding:
    - Used BuiltWith to identify companies and to score them by their tech stack & fit
    - Qualified companies using revenue and tech data
    - Used Prospeo to map the full TAM
    - Identified 3 different KDM personas
    - Built a targeted list of 3x15,000+ prospect lists for each persona

2. Set up a diversified email infra:
    - Set up multiple mailing servers to be able to send 175,000 emails monthly
    - Run weekly inbox placement tests (to ensure emails land in the inbox, not the spam)
    - Continuously monitored deliverability
    - Optimized sending patterns based on performance

3. Tested 3 different offers:
    - free CX optimization
    - different incentives
    - executive meeting with the CEO to provide product feedback

4. Used Apify, Builtwith, and Apollo.io to customize the campaigns by:
    - App installations/uninstalls
    - Competitor movements
    - Complementary tech usage
    - Industry-specific triggers

Results?

- 33 positive responses in 45 days
- ~20% positive response rate
- Best segment: 1 persona (CEO) resonated better than the other personas
- Best offers: short, value-based emails, offering value upfront

Key learnings and what to do if youre in a similar situation:

#1 Speed of execution

- Launch campaigns quickly to test multiple angles
- Pivot based on data

#2 Volume + with good enough personalization

- High-volume outreach (to accelerate learning) but with customized messaging
- Xou dont have time (nor the insights) to make the copy perfect, which is TOTALLY OK

#3 Value-first messaging

- Short, punchy emails with a clear value proposition and a strong offer

urn:li:ugcPost:7332760162157355008,"If somebody would ask me what the 7 tools are TRULY must-haves, Id list these  and heres why:

1� Claygent (AI Agents)

With traditional tools, you cant capture customized information, like case studies listed on the site, changes on the website, or videos/content on the website. 

With Claygent, you can hire AI agents to do the research for you and dig into the unstructured data on demand. 

Almost like an intern, but its easier to train.

Where to get it: Clay 

2��lemlist 
Best in class for multichannel outreachand they let you record personalized voice notes! Theres nothing quite like hearing a real voice in your inbox or DMs. 

Best of all, in my opinion, voice notes are underutilized and seriously boost reply rates. If you arent using them, you absolutely should.

3� Instantly.ai 

Programmatic prospecting used to be a nightmare and super costly. You paid thousands per user. Now its $99 for 25k contacts, and you can scale unlimitedly. 

Plus, you get all the other fundamental features like the warmup you really need to have if you're cold emailing.

4� Website Deanonymizers

You dont need forms anymore to see who is browsing your site (which is pretty awesome!). Perfect use case for do more with what you have. 

There is a lot of dissatisfaction with them because, yes, you have to pay for unqualified traffic. We average see 10-20% of the traffic qualified  and not leveraging that is a missed opportunity 

If you want to turn that ship around, the tools we use: Vector ={,  RB2B , Customer.io 

5� Apify

Custom scrapers = less likely to be used/worn out = more responses/better/creative campaigns.

Theres an actor for almost anything: job listings, product reviews, event datayou name it.

Its almost like if you cant get it with Apify, nobody can get it. 

6� PhantomBuster 

Similar to Apify, but with plug-and-play micro-workflows you can chain together. Want to grab LinkedIn posts, enrich profiles, and then drop everything into your CRM automatically?

It makes those mini-automations super easy.

7� ZenRows
Scrape any website, get back clean JSON, and let their proxy network handle the tough stuff. 

You dont need extra setup, no blocked requests.

Systemize it. Automate it. Put it on rails.

The teams that win in outbound arent the most creative.
Theyre the most disciplined in turning success into a repeatable system.

Its the difference between:
� A chef who remakes the same dish from scratch every night 
vs.
� A kitchen that runs like clockwork with tested recipes, prepped ingredients, and a smooth line.

Campaigns are no different.

When you get a campaign/angle that works?

Dont rebuild it.
Systemize it. Automate it. Put it on rails.

Because if youre constantly in build mode, you never enter optimize/scale mode.

And if you never optimize, youll never scale.

The goal:
� Build once
� Validate
� Let it run
� Improve over time

Not start from zero every Monday.

urn:li:activity:7330948210502402048,"A friend asked me: Whats the one thing that actually made a difference in your success?

At first, I thought about all the usual answersstrategy, timing, and the right opportunities.

It was never about the strategy.

It was about how I approached everything that I borrowed from others during my journey: 

1��Feedback is fuel.

Every piece of feedback is an opportunity. You can take it as criticism or use it to get better. Your choice. 

Early on, I also used to push back when someone pointed out a flaw in my work.

Now? I ask myself: What can I take from this to improve?

2� Invest in assets. But first, invest in yourself.

People underestimate how much AI, writing, and new skills that technology opens up compound over time. The best investment youll ever make is in your ability to adapt and grow.

3��Balance ambition with gratitude.

Dont get so caught up in chasing the next milestone that you forget to appreciate where you are.

4��Consistency beats everything.

You dont have to be the best. You just have to keep going.

A consistent person will always outperform someone with more talent, more funding, or more resources.  My personal motto: never quit! never stop. 

5��The more you give, the more you get.

In business, in relationships, and in lifehelping others always comes back.

The best clients Ive worked with? The ones who focus on long-term results, not quick wins.

The best hires Ive seen? The ones who give more than expected before being asked.

Play long-term games with long-term people.

6��Play the long run. 
The ones who stick around the longest are the ones who win. You dont have to be the bestyou just have to keep doing the right things for long enough.

7��Think less, do more. 

Most people dont fail because they made the wrong move. They fail because they made no move at all.

8��Failure isnt optional. Its necessary.

1. Deep Market Intelligence:
    
    We pull live data weekly to build TAM by identifying companies that are:
    
    - Installing/uninstalling specific apps
    - Switching to competitors
    - Using complementary tech
    - Meeting specific vertical triggers
    - Meeting other custom triggers

2.Custom campaign strategy:
    
     We build 4+ new campaigns per month for testing:
    
    - Company-specific triggers
    - Persona-based messaging
    - Value proposition variants
    - Different lead magnets/offers

3.Performance benchmarking:
    
     Our campaigns fall into 3 categories:
    
    - 1 positive per 200 leads � scale
    - 1 positive per 800 leads � normal campaign
    - 1 per 800+ after 10 campaigns � iterate & experiment

4.Automation & scale:

 Once we find what works, we build a sales process that can prospect these people in a repeatable, automated, and predictable way. Why?

You are busy today, and its not going to change by tomorrow - done is better than perfect!

If you do something every week/every day, its frequent, therefore, you should automate it. (huge efficiency win)

How to do this?

- Monitor different signals on the target accounts lists (i.e, job posts, comments, tech installs)
- Enrich CRM daily/weekly/monthly to keep data fresh
- Automatically prospect eligible contacts every day
- Run personalized messaging at scale
- Have a seamless SDR/lead handoff process (=manage responses)

The results speak for themselves:
 80+ positive responses in 60 business days
 25% positive response rate (industry average is 5-15%)
 4+ optimized campaigns monthly
 Fully personalized outreach for each prospect

The key? =

Stop obsessing over a perfect copy and start testing fast. Speed always wins.

And data will tell you what to scale, pick up, or drop!

One of the prospects we spoke to wanted an AI-driven outbound solution that could analyze their ideal customer profile, generate personalized sequences at scale, and automatically optimize send times and messagingall without ANY manual step/human work.

I could have drafted a detailed proposal, vetted every new AI add-on, AI agents, and run dozens of proof-of-concepts, and booked weeks of team workshops.

But I didnt bother.

Tomorrow, another all-in-one AI outreach platform will launch, claiming to handle everything for free. And the reality is, the core capabilities already exist. 

What really matters is having a partner who understands both the AI technology and the outbound playbooks it needs to support.

If youre a business owner, sales leader, or RevOps executive, its tempting to chase every shiny AI feature. 

The trouble is that if you do it every month, you end up tangled in half-baked deployments. 

As soon as you onboard a new platform, you spend 20+ hours learning its quirks, stress-testing its models, and training your teamusually for only a marginal bump in response rates.

So whats the answer?

You need to outsource these decisions to experts who understand both the AI stack and the outbound motion, and how they work together.

 Found talent acquisition/HR/DEI leaders by country at scale using Amplemarket's Clay integration

 Segmented these prospects into separate workflows
 Added name drops & reference angles based on similarity (""snake tail"" lookup logic in Clay)

The result?

Every prospect received messaging that reflected the real hiring language their team was using  and how it could be improved.

We didnt just say, ""Saw you're hiring.""

We said, ""We analyzed your job ad  heres a way to make it more inclusive.""

    Email used to be our entire motion.
    Now? Were seeing more replies come from LinkedIn DMs and even voice notes.
    
    It felt weird at first. Voice messages on LinkedIn? STILL works???

    Sometimes the difference between a ghosted message and a booked meeting is just& adding a face or a voice.
    
2. Over-framing personalization killed clarity
    
    We tried the I saw you did Xkudos for Y! style.
    
    You know the type: 
    
    I saw your team raised $4M and hired a RevOps leadsuper exciting times!
    
    Heres the issue:
    
    The lead already knows what they did.
    
    We were spending half the message telling them their own story, just to squeeze in our pitch.
    
    Now we lead with: 
    
    Youre likely hiring because [insert relevant insight]. Weve helped similar teams unblock [insert problem]. Want to see how?
    
    Clarity > Flattery. Always.
    
3. Sending 2k emails ` Testing outbound properly
    
    In certain cases, we needed to think 2,000 emails would be enough to get a feel for performance.

    You need volume to get meaningful learnings.
    
    Yes, quality matters. Yes, personalization matters.

What cold outreach tools tell you:

Go to settings and click on connect, and your email addresses are connected, and you can start sending emails.

What you actually need to do:

1. Buy new email addresses
2. Buy new domains that are not your primary domain
3. Set up the MX records
4. Set up DKIM records
5. Set up the SPF records
6. Update the DNS records
7. Forward the domain
8. Configure each and every email address
9. Forward the email addresses 
10. Rotate the IP addresses 
11. Set up the warming
12. Monitor the email addresses health
13. Fix a lot of issues on warming 

And this list is almost endless. 

And it takes a lot of hours.

I used to do all these for each and every email address in 2021. 

But In 2025?

I pretty much automate this with Maildoso.

They handle IP rotation, domain setup, and mailbox configuration automatically... so you never have to touch DNS settings again. 

It doesnt matter how many hours you spend crafting the strongest prospect list, the best copy, and the most relevant messaging IF YOU LAND IN SPAM.

No email in inbox = ZERO chance of response. Be it an objection or a positive reply...

And unlike Gmail and other email providers that require you to do all the infrastructure setup. 

Maildoso will literally do all these for you.

You just need to connect the mailboxes to your outreach tool, turn on the warmup, and wait 14 days until theyre warmed up fully and ready to launch your campaigns.

The full process is in the video =G

2��Any new company is automatically checked for ICP fit.
� If it matches, its added to your active TAM.
� If it doesnt, its removed from your pipeline.

3��Once a company is an ICP account:
� Identify website visitors with Vector ={ 
� Track hiring signals using Apify and Clay,
� Monitor tech stack changes with BuiltWith & HG Insights 
� Watch job changes via Apollo.io, or Clay
� Use custom triggers like negative reviews, FB ad activity, and niche hiring intel via Clay or Apify
� Fallback scrapers via Claygent when other signals fail

4�� We find and enrich key decision-makers across all relevant personas
5��Use waterfall enrichment via Prospeo.io, Icypeas, and FullEnrich for email & phone
6��Contacts are routed to the right Instantly sequence
7��We sync replies, campaign data, and intent signals back into your CRM

A year ago, the market was buzzing about Clay.

But if that were true:
Every 19-year-old with an API key would be running a top-tier agency.
and every sales team would 2Xing their revenue quarterly. 

But theyre not. Because tools dont build success. Teams do.

So heres the real question we always ask ourselves:

- Are we systemizing what works?
- Are we solving for outcomes or just selling unlimited Clay builds?

- Revenue size.
- Tech stack.
- Industry relevance.

We focused on 3 KDM groups and found that CEOs responded the best, highlighting the importance of persona testing.

2� Validating emails at scale

To send emails at 50k/month, we used:

- Apollo.io to collect and validate email addresses.
- Weekly inbox placement tests to ensure every email hits the inbox, not the spam folder.

3� Offer testing that deliver results

In competitive spaces, generic pitches dont cut it. 

We tested:
- Free optimization offers.
- Incentives.
- 1:1 meetings with CEOs.

The winner? Short, value-based emails with actionable insights upfront.

The Results

- 33 positive responses in 45 days.
- ~20% positive response rate
- CEOs were the best-performing persona, validating the importance of targeting leadership in outbound campaigns.

ZoomInfo: Offers funding updates and enriches contact data.
PitchBook: Tracks venture capital and private equity activity.

4. Techstack expansion

Tools like BuiltWith analyze the source code of website to identify tech changes. This helps you know when a company is adding/replacing tools.

BuiltWith: Detects tech stacks used by companies.
G2 : Tracks software research and comparisons.

5. Content Engagement

One of our clients had problems with too many bounced emails, invalid email addresses, and missing LinkedIn information. 

This happened because they only used Clay to find and personalize leads without checking if the data was accurate.

This is how we fixed it:

1� Step 1: Pull contacts into Clay

- Import leads from Apollo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, or CSV uploads.
- These leads have company names, job titles, and sometimes emails (but often unverified or outdated).

2� Step 2: Use Icypeas to verify & enrich emails

Inside Clay, we connected the Icypeas API to:

- Find & verify professional emails for each contact.
- Validate catchall emails (Google & Microsoft).
- Ensure minimal bounce rates before sending any emails.

3� Step 3: Scrape additional data for hyper-personalization

After email verification, we used Clays enrichment capabilities to:

- Pull LinkedIn profile details (headline, skills, experience).
- Find recent activity (posts, engagement).
- Extract company tech stack, funding rounds, and other triggers.

4� Step 4: Push verified data into outreach sequences

Once leads are fully verified & enriched, we push them into:

- Cold email sequences (using Instantly/Smartlead).
- LinkedIn DM outreach (using Lemlist or LaGrowthMachine)
- High-personalization outbound campaigns  - leveraging data from Clay

Within 28 days of integrating this workflow, their reply rates improved by 2.2x.

Heres a little story:

When we worked with a SaaS client recently, we took a different approach: tailored campaigns designed specifically for their ICP and industry.

The client had tried outbound before, but the results were underwhelminglow response rates and no meaningful conversations. 

Why?

L Pre-built templates that didnt resonate with their audience.
L Broad targeting that missed decision-makers.
L Over-engineered copy that lacked speed and adaptability.

We threw out the playbook and built from scratch:

1� Tailored messaging:

- Custom offers and angles for their unique ICP.
- Personalized copy for decision-makers, not just gatekeepers.

2� Hyper-targeted list building:

- Focused on industry relevance, company size, and job roles.
- Tested multiple lead segments to find the best-performing one.

3� Iterative campaign testing:

- Launched campaigns fastno waiting weeks for perfection.
- Constantly tested angles and turned off underperforming ones.

The results:

1 positive response/200 leads.
High response rates = scalable campaigns.
The client closed deals in weeks, not months.

There's a systematic way to diagnose and fix the REAL problems that are killing your results.

Here's the proven 4-part audit framework:

1� Technical foundation

Check your sending infrastructure first. 

Verify SPF/DKIM setup, and warm up domains properly.

Keep daily volume under 50 emails per inbox. 

Use Maildoso & GlockApps 

2� Targeting accuracy

Validate your audience data using tools like  Clay or Apollo.io 

Most campaigns fail because they target the wrong people with outdated info. 

Get this right before moving forward.

3� Message optimization

Keep it simple: plain text only, no fancy HTML, and test link placement. 

Use tools like Mail-Tester to check spam scores. 

But don't touch copy until technical and targeting are solid.

4� Review sending pattern

Analyze delays between:

1.  email & LinkedIn steps, 
2. follow-up timing, and 
3. the number of touchpoints used

Most people send too many emails too quickly or dont follow-up consistently once a lead shows interest.

Follow this framework step by step and you'll hit 10%+ reply rates consistently.

I spent countless hours last year investigating cold email deliverability and found a shocking truth - most businesses operate blindly when it comes to deliverability.

Here's what nobody tells you about cold email infrastructure:
1� Infrastructure Matters More Than Copy
2� Your brilliant email means nothing if it lands in spam
3� Most providers focus on features, not fundamentals
4� Domain reputation is everything

What Actually Works
� Dedicated IP addresses
� Proper DNS configuration
� Automated warmup sequences
� Real-time deliverability monitoring

The Hidden Cost
� Every bounced email damages your domain
� Poor delivery = wasted spend
� Lost opportunities compound monthly

Truth is, deliverability is becoming a full-time job on its own. If you don't want to spend those countless hours like I did, use Maildoso. I wish I found them sooner.

My top 5 reasons for using Maildoso:
=� 98% email deliverability rate because of their dedicated in-house infrastructure
=� Automated domain and mailbox setup - you will never have to touch a DMARC record ever again
=� Seamless integration with cold email tools like Instantly, Lemlist, Smartlead, etc.
=� Daily inbox placement tests to ensure consistent performance
=� Quick and reliable support when you need it the most

Bonus points: they just launched a coaching program - if you want to learn the ins and outs of email deliverability, you can get:

1. Too few sends

Running complex automation for 150 leads per month? 

Dont overcomplicate your messaging and automation. 

Keep it simple. Simplicity and speed always win.

2. Not all inbound leads are equal:
- Net-new small accounts � Smart automation sequence
- Enterprise prospects � Dedicated 1:1 sales rep motion
- Existing clients � Skip automation completely
- Active pipeline � Sales rep alerts and task automation

We saw 42% higher conversion rates after implementing this segmentation.

3. Managing multiple audience types? 

Here's what worked for us:

- Create distinct sequences per audience
- Route traffic to persona-specific landing pages
- Use Clay to personalize every touchpoint
- Implement dynamic content based on visitor behavior

4. Traffic based sequences
With 1000 monthly visitors, tools only reveal:
- 15% of individual visitors
- 65% of company identities
- Focus your automation on the identified companies and use a human touch to personalize your approach.

5. VIP experience gap
For enterprise clients ($30k ACV), we:
- Send real-time alerts to sales reps
- Enable 1:1 personalization at scale
- Create tailored content journeys
- Track multi-stakeholder engagement

The hard truth? 

Most companies are doing inbound-led outbound all wrong. 

They're trying to automate everything when they should be automating the right things.

I found myself redesigning our entire sales process after diving into their content.

2��Mentorship from Mark

Having someone who's been there, done that, and is willing to share the real, nitty-gritty details is a good one.

He's called me out on my BS more than once, and my business is better for it.

3��If you're not listening to ""How I Built This"" by NPR, you're missing out

Real stories of people who've scaled businesses.

Every biz is different but the concept is pretty much applicable to whatever you do.

4��The Tim Ferriss Show

Love the mindset and habits of high performers.

You can get some pretty decent productivity hacks 

5��Oh, and there's this book, ""The E-Myth Revisited"". 

It got us thinking differently about our day-to-day operations. 

Made things smoother for both us and our clients.

The best resource is the one that gets you moving. So find what resonates with you and run with it.

Here are 5 ways to get responses WITHOUT relying on company signals:

1. The network leverage play
Found a game-changing way to use case studies:
Make your champion the hero, find their connections, and share their success story.


2. Vertical champions
Instead of generic ""similar companies,"" we segment by industry and showcase relevant wins.
Think: ""Here's how 3 other fintech companies solved this""
The secret? Predictable, evergreen pipeline.

3. The influencer echo
Target prospects who engage with industry thought leaders.
""Loved your comment on [influencer's] post about [topic]. Here's how we helped another company achieve that...""

4. Expert content deposits
Skip the sales pitch. Share valuable insights.
Example: ""Noticed you're scaling your SDR team. Here's our quota-setting calculator based on desired outcomes""
Pure value, zero pitch.

5. Short & Sweet Authority
Two sentences max:
- Relevant observation
- No-brainer offer
That's it.

The best part? Its evergreen. You set it up once and then let it run on autopilot.

Been thinking a lot about growth lately - not just business growth, but personal growth.

I spend my days:

- Talking to prospects
- Creating POCs
- Following up
- Closing deals
- Managing everything

And you know what? It's holding us back.

The hardest pill to swallow as a founder?

Your team can often do things BETTER than you can.

But here's what keeps me up at night:

- Can I trust them enough?
- Will quality stay consistent?
- What if something goes wrong?

Then I remind myself of our core mission:
To be a net-positive investment for every client.
To bring real value to the table.
To be decent humans doing good work.

And here's the truth:
I can't deliver on that mission if I'm drowning in the details.

So I'm learning (slowly) to:

1. Trust my team more
2. Enable rather than control
3. Let go of perfect
4. Focus on what only I can do

It's uncomfortable. It's scary. But it's necessary.

AI tools can give you back 90% of the time youd spend writing emails. Does this mean you can start sending out mass emails written by ChatGPT? NO! L

First, you need a strategy.

Your outbound campaign needs to: 
�Identify the issue the prospect is facing

� Highlight their current circumstances

� Present a strong value proposition

� Provide relevant social proof

� Make a strong offer (dont ignore this!)

�Include a clear CTA

1. Do your research first. These tools help:
    - Use Clay
    - and LinkedIn Sales Navigator for list building and researching your prospects,
    - Common Room to aggregate data, [RB2B](http://rb2b/) to hit inbound leads visiting the website.

2. Start planning your campaign:
    - Apollo.io Put leads automatically to sequencing based on intent and sync them to your CRM.
    - Salesloft Helps prioritize and take action on what matters most.
    - Outreach To build an outreach process that is structured, aligned, and repeatable.

3. Speed up/fine-tune writing:
    - Instantly.ai  Generates personalized email sequences and includes features like spintax and A/B testing.
    - Smartlead  Use SmartDelivery to see if youre hitting the inbox and use spintax, and A/B testing to personalize emails for every recipient.

Use AI as an enabler to speed up researching the accounts and prospects  and automate the tedious tasks of prospecting.

urn:li:ugcPost:7278416956532178944,"Want your cold emails to land straight in the spam folder? Follow these tips!

1. Send long emails with all the extras
    
    Load your emails with images. Embed your product demo. Attach a PDF. Spam filters love these and will ensure your email never sees the light of day.
    
    Oh, and dont forget to start with I hope this email finds you well.
    
2. Jazz up your signature
    
    Add photos, links, phone numbers, and domains to your signature. Make it as creative and complicated as possible.
    

3. Add an open tracker

Obsess over tracking open rates. Sure, Google will flag your emails as suspicious, but at least youll know who didnt open them.

4. Dont check for spam words

Forget about checking for spam words. Why bother?

5. Build ONE campaign for the quarter and stick to it

Why run multiple campaigns when you can stick to one and watch your open rates stagnate? Consistency is key!

6. Dont just let them unsubscribe  make them work for it

Who cares about GDPR? Forget the unsubscribe sentence or link and let your emails get flagged for non-compliance.

Just add a line Reply not interested to opt-out.

7. Ignore syntax variability

Forget about using SPINTAX to keep your emails varied. Keep everything the same and let spam filters easily recognize and block your messages.

Follow these tips and watch your emails vanish into the spam folder!

If youd rather have your emails read by executives, theres a great deliverability guide by Maildoso we use for our emails. 

Check out the link in the comments. 

PS: Before New Year, it's the perfect time to buy new domains and inboxes in advance as you can get all of the new inboxes warmed up, so you can start strong in Q1.

- No clear ICP & problem: No defined ICP or clear problem-solving focus.

Sure, we have to accept that some things are out of our hands:

- how much they are willing to invest
- resources/budget
- immediate need

But you can influence these:

1. List building & segmentation strategy
    
    ICPs evolve. You might have done your research but you can always add new layers to improve targeting.
    
    Get Clay and LinkedIn Sales Nav for list building and researching your prospects
    Use Common Room to get a LOT of data
    

2. Rethink your channels
    
    LinkedIn is limited  not every persona (think developers) is on the platform. 
    
    Find prospects email and build a repeatable outreach strategy using relevant channels:
    
    - RB2B to hit inbound leads visiting the website
    - Apollo.io to access millions of email addresses right away
    - Instantly.ai for programmatic prospecting
    - lemlist for multichannel prospecting
    - Outreach for bigger sales teams
    
    Fav one: Prospeo.io to scrape leads/accounts from Sales Nav
    
2. Add value and personalization to your messaging (..and improve deliverability)
    - Instantly.ai to add spintax and A/B testing
    - Smartlead for testing inbox placement (you can automate campaign testing!)
    
3. Give them a reason to talk to you
    
    Offer real value to your prospects  they dont respond/book because they dont see the value in doing so, heres how to fix this:
    
    - Content offer
    - An incentive like a gift card
    - A free audit/swipe files etc.
    
4. Optimize your email infrastructure
    
    Use a mix of G Suite, Microsoft, and Custom providers. 

For example:
    - G-suite sends well to G-suite
    - Use custom if you target enterprises who use Microsoft

4. Keep it simple and text-based. They're less likely to trigger spam filters and they feel more personal 

Wondering if your idea would stick? That was me, not so long ago. 

Friday late afternoon meant sitting in silence, doubting a lot of decisions. 

It's another Friday, and I'm surrounded by a team of 8 incredible individuals, each bringing their own magic to the table.

The journey? Far from easy. 

Here's what it really took:

- Self-awareness
    
The hardest thing you can learn is knowing yourself. Overcoming my traits that amplify or slow down our growth wasnt easy.
    
- Narrowing down the focus
    
Commit to it fully and execute consistently. 
Decide what you really want to solve and stick to it.
    
- Build the right team
    
That one that shares the vision and complements your strengths. 
Be willing to make tough decisions if they dont.
    
- Ruthless prioritization
    
Tasks and strategies that move the needle today, rather than only focusing on future possibilities. 
    
- Relentless learning 
Every setback was a lesson. 
Failures become the greatest feedback. 
We fail forward.

And to anyone experiencing the same: 

It's okay to doubt. To struggle. To pivot.

That's not failure - it's growth.

Its NOT going to be easy but so worth it.

urn:li:activity:7263196300198772736,"Heres how we used our 3-step process to help a B2B SaaS fix its declining cold email open rates (...it's not the subject line)

If your cold email campaigns produce worse results than before, you're not alone.

One of my clients faced this exact problem last week.

After auditing their campaigns, we found 3 key issues:

1� Poor email deliverability setup 

- If your emails aren't reaching inboxes, nothing else matters.
- Fixing technical setup is boring but crucial for success.

2� Generic, mediocre email copy

- Sending the same message to everyone won't cut it anymore.
- You need to deeply personalize based on each prospect's unique challenges.

3� Lack of consistent follow-up 

- Most sales happen after 5+ touches.
- You need a repeatable system to reach out to prospects multiple times over 3-6 months.

Here's how we solved it:

 Optimized email authentication & infrastructure
 Wrote custom copy for each prospect based on their pain points
 Build a programmatic outbound system to reprospect people (lack of engagement, or hit a specific score)

The result?

� Open rates are 2xd.

The = key lesson:

What worked yesterday won't work today.
You need to adapt your approach constantly.
Focus on both quality AND quantity.

That's how you stand out in a crowded inbox and drive results in 2024.

Heres how to fix them:

1� Outreach without strategy
L Mistake: Firing off emails without a plan
 Fix: Create a detailed Ideal Account Profile (IAP). Research EVERYTHING about your perfect customer.

2� Generic ""personalization""
L Mistake: {FirstName} doesn't cut it anymore
 Fix: Get creative! Brainstorm unique ways to connect with your IAP. Stand out in their inbox.

3� Spray & pray approach
L Mistake: Blasting every contact you can find
 Fix: Quality over quantity. Prioritize and focus on your most promising prospects.

4� Unclear ICP & value proposition
L Mistake: Vague messaging that doesn't resonate
 Fix: Clearly articulate WHY them and HOW you provide unique value. Be specific!

5� No compelling reason to connect
L Mistake: ""I'd love to chat about how we can help""
 Fix: Offer upfront value. Give them an irresistible reason to engage

Dont forget: people dont respond because you have nothing relevant to say to them. 

Give them a reason to respond. 

Be it a monetary incentive, a gift or an actionable playbook. 

And for Mistake #1, watch the video in the comment section of how you can use Clay to qualify, and score 10k+ accounts in less than 5 minutes. Automate the tedious account research and focus more on selling! 

urn:li:activity:7256673315967164418,"6 cold email hacks to significantly improve your deliverability (... do these and youll never land in SPAM).

1� Custom Tracking Domain
We set up our domain. 
This helps email service providers like Google make your domain more legit.

Pro tip: With privacy changes from Apple and Google, focus on response rates instead of open rates.

2� Domain & IP Warm-Up
We always start slow, gradually increasing our email volume over weeks and randomizing it. 

This again, builds trust  Google needs to know you're not some spam-happy newbie.

3� List Segmentation
We always get picky with our lists, and suggest anybody to do the same. 

We are dividing them into hyper-targeted segments. 

More relevance = more engagement = better deliverability = better results (responses)

4� Dynamic Content
We make our emails reference the persona's pain points like why we are reaching out to them and how we can help. 

5� Domain & IP Rotation
We spread our traffic across multiple domains and IPs. 
Never put all your eggs in one basket - reduces the risk of getting blacklisted.

6� Weekly // Bi-weekly monitoring

We keep an eye on the sender's reputation using domain health and check if our email responses are reducing.
This way, if there is an issue well know it. 

Bonus: Were experimenting with automated reporting to get automatically notified if our sequence results are falling behind the benchmarks, so we can resolve it. 

Most important: 

1. Dont treat these 6 tips as a set-it-and-forget. These are ongoing, so make sure you keep an eye on them and follow them.
2. Disable open tracking.

Cut out anyone who doesn't give you the positive energy you need to grow. 

Find people who lift you up.

2� Never give up 

Keep pushing and pushing, even when it gets tough. 

A few weeks or months later, you'll look back and see how far you've come.

3� You've already conquered yourself

So what's the solution?

 Include trust-building elements in your outreach.

 Share meaningful content that provides genuine value.

 Aim to nurture relationships, not just pitch your product.

How to do this:

1� Send personalized emails that show you've done your research.

2� Provide free resources or insights that help solve their problems.

3� Focus on building rapport before trying to sell anything.

The key is to invest in relationship-building alongside your cold outreach.

This way, you're not just asking for a sale, but establishing yourself as a trusted resource.

And when they ARE ready to buy, guess who they'll think of first?

That's right - YOU!

So next time you're crafting a cold email campaign, include those trust-building touches.

It might take more effort upfront, but it pays off in the long run.

We've been playing around with mentioning the prospect's colleague in our outreach, and holy moly, its GOOD.

Why?

- feels familiar 
- shows you've done your homework (even if you haven't) 
- higher chances of your email making the rounds 

3 ways we're slipping in that colleague's name:

1� ""Is this something you or {{colleague}} are dealing with?""
2� ""Can I send more info to you or {{colleague}}?""
3� ""Hey {{first_name}}, not sure if this should go to you or {{colleague}}.""

This makes your email more personal, and less like a mass email and shows you did your research.

Except we dont, just use technology to mimic exactly what an SDR would do manually. 

We built a workflow that:

1. Stalks... I mean, visit their company's LinkedIn
2. Grabs a colleague's info (but not the prospect's)
3. Finds and verify the colleague's email
4. Drops in the colleague's name (and title if we're feeling fancy)

All we do is add ""{{colleague}}"" to our email template, and BOOM! Hyper-relevant emails at scale.

Ever since it became available, weve been running a ton of tests on these types of campaigns, these are my top 5 insights to make your website visitor sequences your best performing one.

1. Filter for ICP visitors 

Not all of your visitors are created equal. Filter for your best fit ICP and only message the ones that matter the most. Filter based on job title, revenue, seniority & industry.

2. Add delay to your workflow 

Speed to lead is crucial, but giving some headspace for people is just as important. Dont send emails to website visitors immediately, as it may come across as intrusive for privacy conscious prospects.

3. Use exclusion lists 

There will be accounts that your sales team is already in touch with. Existing customers and partners will also visit your site from time to time. 

Message them, and youll be deemed unprofessional. Maintain clean exclusion lists and use them for every campaign.

4. Add personalized videos to your campaign 

Double your campaigns engagement rate by using personalized video in your outreach. Sendspark is a game changer for this.

5. Dont say Hey I saw youve been on our pricing page 

Its kind of creepy to mention that in your outreach. Find other relevant reasons to reach out, and keep it to yourself.

� Buy 2-3 mailboxes per domain
� Set up SPF, MX, DKIM, and DMARC
� Warmup the email inboxes (and keep the warmup on while prospecting)

You can get this done with one click with Maildoso 

#2 List building

� Only 1-3% of your TAM is in market at any give time. Use sales triggers and intent signals to make your email more timely and relevant
� Double verify emails
� Remove unsubscribes, bounces from your email list

#3 Copywriting

� Use text-only emails (no HTML)
� Have a crazy simple signature (no links, images, or gifs)
� Scan every email for spam trigger words (ex: revenue)
� Never send the same stuff for too long. Update copy every 2-6 weeks

#4 Offer

� Create an irresistible offer. Dont ask for too much immediately, just be curious and helpful to get a conversation started.

Bad CTA:
� Do you want to jump on a call tomorrow?
Good CTA:
� Can I show you how& {{ABC}}

Bad offers:

Good offer: 
� SEO audit

When our client first reached out to us, they were in a tough spot: they hadn't landed a single booking in the North American market. They were successful in other markets, but they weren't sure if this market could work, and honestly, neither were we at first. 

But we believe that the key to finding what works is by running smart, targeted experiments on different market segments and messaging, and by doing that you can find something. 

In the end, if something works, you can improve it. If not, you can still fix it. 

So, here's what we did to help them get their first bookings in just seven days:

1. We brainstormed a list of experiments that we thought could work and picked the top three to start with.
2. We kept things simple and focused, working with a small list size to quickly test different ideas.
3. We tried out multiple angles to see what resonated with the dev audience, which we know can be trickier than other groups from an outbound perspective.
4. We enriched our prospect lists with phone numbers because you just can't beat a good old-fashioned phone call or BDR outreach.

The dev space is super competitive (believe me, worked and consulted in 4+ dev SaaS), and if you want to come out on top, you need to be willing to experiment and find what works for your specific situation.

Before:

1. Checking regularly open rates and response rates
2. Using primary domains, not thinking about secondary domains
3. Using images, links in cold emails

Now: 

1. Setup 3 email inbox per domain
2. Disable open tracking 
3. Document your response rates and benchmarks and measure your results against them  
4. Keep it simple and text-based. They're less likely to trigger spam filters and they feel more personal 
5. Write subject lines that make people want to read more. Focus on less about tricking people into opening your email and more to deliver value they can't resist 

1. We uncovered a lot of efficiency issues. And I mean A LOT of them. And we wanted to solve them fast now and forever. So automated the majority of them.

2. We're leveraging powerful tools to document our processes

5 ones that are absolutely nothing we havent used before but wanted to connect the dots between them:
    
    - Notion  - For centralized documentation
    - Airtable  - For flexible, customizable process tracking
    - Miro - For visual workflow mapping
    - Make  - For automating repetitive tasks
    - Slack  - For seamless team communication

3. We're looking into the team's effectiveness

We don't bill clients based on hours worked. But understanding where our team loses efficiency is CRUCIAL:
    
    - less frustration = more creativity
    - hit the ground running
    - no more ""it depends on who does it
    - the stuff that REALLY moves the needle

I've always been a fan of no-code automation. 

During my partnership sales days, I loved the meetings and conversations... but HATED the admin work.

That's why I'm so passionate about streamlining operations. 

It frees up our team to focus on what they do best  delivering incredible results for our clients.

Take a hard look at your operations. What processes could use some love?

We both know revenue isnt the only/best growth indicator of an E-commerce store.

Our customer had been using PPSY for years to track their monthly order volume, however, they noticed it was significantly higher than the stores actual results.

So we developed a custom model to estimate the monthly order volumes of their prospects, at a fraction of the costs. 

Result:

- PPSY's estimates were off by a whopping 2x compared to the actual results.
- Our model, on the other hand, was only 20% off from the real numbers

Were continuously hitting some amazing milestones with Growth Today in terms of revenue, team size, creating SOPs, automating tedious work, etc.

Sounds simple, right? It wasn't.

Here's the raw truth about big achievements that no one talks about:

1. They're exhausting.
2. They require sacrifices. Say goodbye to your social life (temporarily).
3. Just when you think you've given it all, you need to dig deeper.
4. The hardest part? Staying positive when you're running on fumes.

But it's 100% worth it.

The irony? 

Client delivery often leaves little time for these high-impact tasks.

It's the classic urgent vs. important dilemma.

But by pushing through and getting a month ahead by automating more, and more and more and more SOPs, we have more time to stop reacting.

As a self-proclaimed control freak, I used to think I needed to know everything, control every process, and drive every initiative at my agency.

Spoiler alert: after a certain point in a business, it doesn't work.

Here's why this mindset is a massive bottleneck for scaling your business:

1. You block your team and become the bottleneck
2. Team creativity gets stifled
3. Burnout becomes inevitable (trust me on this one)

But here's the game-changing realization I've had:

Our team is INCREDIBLY competent. Like, blow-your-mind talented.

So why was I holding onto control so tightly?

Fear. Ego. Habit.

Here's what I'm learning (and it's not easy, folks):

- Trust is a superpower
- Hiring smarter people than you
- Lead, not to micromanage
- Accept if we f* up

Using no-code tools is an absolutely gold:

1. you can reclaim a significant amount of time (or even days) of your life by automating repetitive tasks
2. you can eliminate human errors that creep in during monotonous manual work
3. you can handle increased workloads without hiring more people or working crazy hours
4. you can free up your brain power for strategic thinking and creative problem-solving

The best part? 

No code tools are incredibly affordable compared to custom software development.

And you don't need to be a coding genius to get started.

Here are 3 No Code tools I recommend to kickstart your automation journey:

1.  Zapier - Connect apps and automate workflows
2. Airtable  - Build custom databases and processes
3. Bubble - Create web apps without coding

Learning these tools might take a bit of time upfront, but the long-term payoff is MASSIVE.

Imagine all the tedious tasks you could eliminate from your workday&. What would you do with that extra time?

What would you like to automate? Any tools youd recommend besides these?

Built acc/prospect list so small that you wondered if it was even worth reaching out?

Weve been there too. 

Youre not alone.

Heres how we solved this for a client targeting strategic accounts: 

1. We started by building an initial account list. We identified 100 key companiesa solid beginning, but...
2. We only uncovered 1,500 key decision-makers. Far too few to meet any targets.
3. We then integrated a complementary tech stack with several tools, feeding them into a database and creating a custom waterfall process to maximize the results.

The outcome?

Original list: 1,500 key decision-makers (KDMs) with Clay

Enhanced list: 5,500 KDMs

Sometimes, one tool just isnt enough.

Even three tools might fall short.

And while Clays waterfall process is powerful, it has its limits too.

So, when traditional list-building methods arent cutting it, you need to explore alternative solutions.

Our approach, though not yet perfect and requiring a bit of fine-tuning, helped our client to:

 Maximize their addressable market
 Ensure they werent missing out on potential opportunities
 Equip their sales team with a robust pipeline

TLDR

Low open rates = your emails dont land in the inbox  a missed opportunity

Our customer was dealing with an average 20% open rate, which meant they were missing out on a lot of potential deals.

So heres what we did:

1. We started by warming up new email accounts to make sure their emails were getting delivered. Your email can be pixel-perfect, but if it doesnt land in the inbox, it doesnt matter. Thats the truth.
2. Moved and improved their sequences
    
    We took their existing sequences from their CRM and tweaked their setups a bit. 
    
3. Built a customized complex routing system
    
    With 8 SDRs on their team, we wanted to make sure each lead was assigned to the right rep for personalized outreach and fair commissions.
    
    Many tools claim they have the right CRM integrations but in reality, they absolutely dont&
    
    So we build a custom logic that routes the right leads to the right sequences while also syncing this information back to the CRM. 
    

Including which sequence they are in, what was the exact email we sent, and all the campaign data like the date of replies and sentiment of the replies. 

(Not pixel perfect because speed always wins but well fine-tune it)

Results?

- 2X higher open rates  from previous 20% to 50%
- 3% avg response rate  25% being positive =

- $200K MRR influenced in 30 days

And the best part? This is all automated, evergreen.

And the next things were working on:

 Reaching out to event attendees and strategic accounts
 Launching website visitor campaigns
 Fine-tuning analytics a bit in their CRM to optimize and double down on what works

CRM always needs to be the source of truth

And we know what to do to get there.

Experiencing issues with CRM zero visibility of whats going on and whats missing and emails not even hitting the inbox?

Talk to us.

There isnt any issue we havent seen and cant fix.

Be it SFDC, HubSpot, or Marketo.

urn:li:ugcPost:7229116793515081729,"You can never trust self-reported data when youre prospecting. Here are 7 ways how weve helped a $30mil ARR SaaS solve these (&bookmark these tips)

1. B2B vs B2C
    
     � Instead of just checking if a company's focus is B2B vs B2C, assign a score of (1-10) to show the likeability of how much b2b or b2c the company is. This helps you narrow down the possibility of error.
    
     � Look for indicators like:
    
    - job titles (e.g., SDRs for B2B)
    - presence of business tech tools (use Clearbit & BuiltWith  to check for common B2B technologies installed on their website)
    - and website content

1. E-commerce stores
    
     � Store Leads is generally accurate and a great data source but we have found that industry categorization is often off.
    
     �  So we used Claygent to check the top 3 product categories to confirm and fully recategorize the industry and the actual product theyre selling
    
     � If you dont need info about the industry, just want to verify if they are E-com or not - see the video below
    
    - Use Serper to scrape Google Shopping listings to confirm if a company is selling products directly to consumers.
    - Cross-verify with actual product listings and purchase capabilities and which platform theyre using

3.	Selling in Enterprise

� Scrape the companys pricing page with Claygent for keywords like enterprise to see if they offer enterprise-level solutions. You can also check custom  its usually an indicator for enterprise 

 � Check LinkedIn for sales reps with enterprise in their titles to confirm they target large organizations.

 � Use search operators like site:companywebsite dot com ""free trial"" and booking or book a demo to find if a company has a booking link as a call to action. 

- If they only focus on free trial, its very much likely they focus only on PLG motion and unlikely to be an enterprise

1. Finding SaaS companies
    
     �  Scrape Crunchbase pages for self-identification as SaaS
    
     �  Look for common SaaS keywords like Integrations or Partner directory using Google searches or on their website content
    
    � You can also use tools like ZenRows to scrape SimilarWeb data and check if a company attracts a certain level of web traffic from specific age groups.
    

And the best part?

This research which used to be very manual work of SDRs can be fully automated.

Too many people are teaming up with Clay/outbound experts, thinking they need to solve a sales problem.

But in reality, they have a marketing problem. 

They need to work on:

 Building trust with their audience
 Consistently providing real value
 Offering genuine solutions to real problems

So I decided to be upfront with them. 

I shared their resources to help them get their brand out there. 

Yeah sure, I could close them for $5k / mo and wait 3 months until they churn.

But for me, its important what I'm doing actually helping them.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7227304799065538560,,10 months ago,janivrancsik,ACoAAAyVlXMBT484Y_KLDJqBYrRXUvNb9emEq9I,Jani,Vrancsik,"Enterprise Clay Partner agency founder | Sales leaders: I'll help you build a scalable outbound engine that gets meetings booked on autopilot in the next 180 days | DM me ""outbound"" to learn more",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQG4wUDYCvLAGA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1722000838707?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=1uEs2HotqNDTDigOSconu4RW7Z62vFN8uVF9pHIFTzM,,1.0,,,,True,Yes,Yes,No
urn:li:activity:7226942412332363777,"If you think Ambition is the problem, you're WRONG

Inspiration or desire isn't an issue either.

You see high-growth companies making it.

You know it's possible.

But there is always something in the way.

That something is often the perfectionism, the overwhelm, and the short-term mindset.

The ideal customer has to be perfect, the sales message, the system, the funnel, the ads the emails...

Then the overwhelm comes into play.

Then the short-term mindset if something doesn't work out the way you dreamed it at first.

You'll see a new sales method on LinkedIn or hear about it on a podcast. So, you'll switch up your strategy before you even test plan A.

And there's nothing wrong with this.

We've all been there so you're not alone.

Everyone shits their pants before playing.

It's part of the game.

So heres a framework to break through perfectionism, overwhelm, and commitment.

99% of people will see your post, your ad, your email... and scroll past!

1% will click, read, and then bounce!

But 0.1% will give you money!

And before you get disheartened by the 99%. It isn't a rejection!

They aren't scrolling past because they don't like your messaging. It's because they are on their couch watching Netflix or they have their kid jumping all over them or in an important meeting with their CRO... they might be in a different state of mind.

Point being... just launch, and keep testing, testing, and testing and testing.

And then look at the numbers to see how to improve rather than quitting the first time.

Because ANY company can run traditional channels like PPC or Google or build a huge GTM army.

But only 1% of the companies commit to doing the grind work to find and build their motion that is non-copy-pastable.

And if thats going to work, the motion youve built is going to be a competitive edge.

So get into the long-game mindset, hit launch, and iterate as you go.

You'll soon be crunching numbers to find the true way to grow.

p.s how do you try to influence your peers to avoid falling into the trap of perfectionism?

- Cut out anyone who doesn't give you the positive energy you need to grow. 
- Find people who lift you up.
- Sometimes the people you wouldn't think of, will lift you up

2� Never give up 

- Keep pushing and pushing, even when it gets tough. 
- A few weeks or months later, you'll look back and see how far you've come.

3� You've already conquered yourself 

- Even if you don't realize it yet, you have the strength inside to do amazing things. 
- Nothing great happens in your comfort zone.

If your cold email campaigns are producing worse results than before, you're not alone.
One of my clients faced this exact problem last week.

After auditing their campaigns, we found 3 key issues:

1� Poor email deliverability setup
- If your emails aren't reaching inboxes, nothing else matters.
- Fixing technical setup is boring but crucial for success.

2� Generic, mediocre email copy
- Sending the same message to everyone won't cut it anymore.
- You need to deeply personalize based on each prospect's unique challenges.

3� Lack of consistent follow-up 
- Most sales happen after 5+ touches.
- You need a repeatable system to reach out to prospects multiple times over 3-6 months.

Here's how we solved it:

 Optimized email authentication & infrastructure
 Wrote custom copy for each prospect based on their pain points
 Build a programmatic outbound system to reprospect people (lack of engagement, or hit a specific score)

The result?

� Open rates are 2xd.

The =�key lesson:

What worked yesterday won't work today.
You need to adapt your approach constantly.
Focus on both quality AND quantity.

That's how you stand out in a crowded inbox and drive results in 2024.

1� Tactics before strategy
- Writing cold emails, LinkedIn messages immediately
- No strategy of why, how and what and prioritization, just action

2� One-size-fits-none messaging
- Zero or not relevant personalization
- me, me, me messaging, not you, you and you

3� Trying to force-fit your message to an audience
- Spray & pray
- Hoping a broad message will somehow stick

4� Lack of a clear ICP and value proposition
- No clear Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Unclear on what problem you're solving

5� Week offer
- Failing to give prospects a compelling reason to engage and give you 15 mins
- Too salesy call-to-action

These issues aren't isolated - they're connected like a pyramid. 

Heres how to fix them:

1� Craft your Ideal Account Profile (IAP)
- Know your perfect customer inside out
- Who is your dream accounts, who are absolutely not  and what patterns really differentiate them

2� Get creative with outreach
- Brainstorm fresh ways to connect with your IAP
- Maybe the lingo changed from Q2 to Q3

3� Prioritize smartly
- Score and focus on your most promising prospects

4� Be short and sweet and crispy
- Write concise, tailored messages that feels like an internal email
- Make it clear why them, why now and how you can help them

5� Offer real value 
- Give prospects an irresistible reason to meet
- Not just ""Let's chat!"", or do you have 20 mins this week to connect?

1� Cloning ourselves (at least technically)

- Were training AI on how to understand our clients business better. Its hard to scale our knowledge 1:1, but not with AI.

2� Onboarding on autopilot

- Well always be limited by hours. So were making our onboarding into a more advanced, well-oiled machine with an AI twist.
- It's not perfect (yet), but it's a massive leap forward.

3� Copywriting

- We've nailed down 5 key elements for killer copy. Our AI buddy learns your style and pumps out up to 25k personalized emails monthly.
- And you just need to be the editor-in-chief upon reviews.

4� Testing

Most folks aren't running programmatic outbound when they find us. So were most focused on testing the elements that make or break your attention:

- Offers that make prospects say yes
- Subject lines
- Value props that makes sense
- Social proof that build trust
- CTAs

You got it!

Heres how we did it:

1. Estimated the Monthly Order Volume & qualified the accounts within seconds

We used AI to browse through the catalog and categorize the brands in the right industries.

Then we used our conversion rate benchmarks to estimate the conversion rate for each industry and pulled website traffic from Store Leads and Semrush and Similarweb to estimate the Monthly Order Volume.

Based on Monthly Order Volume, we qualified the stores at scale in Clay

2. Further qualify them based on products.

Our client can only store a specific type of product in the warehouses.

So we used AI to browse through the full catalog again and wrote an AI prompt to qualify the stores and return if they sell products we can store in the warehouse.

If they sell products that require freezing, custom personalization alcohol, etc, we disqualify them.

3. Then, we also wrote a GPT prompt to estimate the weight of the products and disqualify if the products were too heavy.

4. Then, we scraped information about what shipping experience they provide to their customers and categorized each company into 4 different sequences.

Result?

If their shipping experience is good, we didnt reach out to them. 
If their shipping experience is bad, we point out the exact problems and offer help.

5. And because we wanted to reach out to 3 different types of KDM from CEOs to VP of E-Commerce to Ops, who have very different goals and challenges, weve built a script to personalize every sentence and CTA for each persona.

Result?

Identifying the companies who have a pain we can solve - without SDRs manually qualifying stores, their products.

And sending genuine, and relevant emails personalized for each persona, instead of generic emails like:

Hey, use our software

OR

thoughts on my last email

IMO, copies are always super subjective and depend on the list you use and what you know about the market/what existing benchmarks you have.

So how do you get started to set yourself up for success?

urn:li:activity:7211722230618066945,"Heres our little secret about how we're building such an incredible AI team day by day (...it all comes down to one thing) 

Most AI companies and Clay experts just throw their team in the deep and expect them to figure it out and burn the hell out of them. 

Weve built this 4-part training system instead:

1. Learning sessions  every week, we all get together and one of our brilliant team members teaches the rest of us something new about prompting or AI.
2. SOPs  we've documented step-by-step guides for all the common things clients need. So our team always has this wealth of proven solutions at their fingertips. 
3. Doing the Hard Stuff   we train them on more complex Growth and RevOps use cases so we can deliver custom campaigns. The kind of stuff you'd need a serious in-house Growth pro for. 
4. Always-On Learning  whenever one of us figures out a better way to solve a problem, we immediately share it on our team Slack. We're all constantly learning from each other in real-time.

Behind the scenes Im building an engine for a better knowledge management process that automates the preparation, sharing and follow-up and gamifies it to make it more effective and engaging.  

At the end of the day, our clients' wins are what keep us going. 

And we know that the only way to keep getting those wins is by having the most skilled, innovative team out there.

So we ruthlessly invest into that.

If you're running a team skilled on AI, I can't recommend investing in training enough. It'll pay off big time.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7211722230618066945,,1 year ago,janivrancsik,ACoAAAyVlXMBT484Y_KLDJqBYrRXUvNb9emEq9I,Jani,Vrancsik,"Enterprise Clay Partner agency founder | Sales leaders: I'll help you build a scalable outbound engine that gets meetings booked on autopilot in the next 180 days | DM me ""outbound"" to learn more",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQG4wUDYCvLAGA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1722000838707?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=1uEs2HotqNDTDigOSconu4RW7Z62vFN8uVF9pHIFTzM,2.0,,,,,True,Yes,No,No
urn:li:activity:7211359736787529728,"5 reasons your outbound strategy is FAILING (... and how to FIX it fast):

Here are 5 deadly mistakes killing your outreach efforts:

1. Self-promotion overload 
    � Your prospects don't care about you. They care about THEIR problems.
    
2. Lazy follow-ups
    � ""Thoughts?"" - the fastest way to get ignored.
    
3. Unrealistic expectations
    � Expecting an immediate ""Yes!"" is a recipe for disappointment.
    
4. Targeting the wrong persona
    � Barking up the wrong tree wastes time and burns potential relationships.
    
5. Generic messaging
    � One-size-fits-all approaches scream ""I didn't bother to research you!""
    

Heres what you should do instead:

1. Use trigger-based messages 
    � Reference specific insights about your prospect. Show why you're reaching out NOW.
    
2. Value-driven follow-ups 
    � Give something genuinely helpful in each touch. Be a resource, not a nuisance.
    
3. Zero expectations 
    � Play the long game. Focus on building relationships, not instant gratification.
    
4. Hyper-targeted list building 
    � Break down your ideal customer profile into ultra-specific challenges, skills, and company traits. Quality over quantity.
    
5. Personalization at scale 
     � Develop a system to quickly research and customize each message.

Spray-and-pray doesn't cut it anymore.

But with these tweaks, youll be able to get a 10-15% positive response rate.

3. Putting more time into good vs worse prospects

urn:li:activity:7206648693305806848,"Top 5 reasons your cold emails are not landing in the inbox:

1) Email List

Most companies L

� Create a list of companies and contacts and use it for a long time

Do this instead 

� Auto-enrich your CRM and remove inactive and no longer at the company contacts (get this for Apollo.io for a decent price)

� Tag unsubscribes and bounced in your CRM/Clay and exclude them from campaigns

2) Media in emails

Most companies L

� You want to be different and you see videos that tell you to use media in emails (GIFs, images, videos)

Do this instead 

� Dont use media on full cold prospects at scale - youll get 50% fewer open rates

(at scale means >10k+ prospects).

Inbound is fine.

(Google treats these differently if you had some interactions with them)

3) List building

Most companies L

� You come up with a generic company/contact list which is not specific enough.

Do this instead 

� Segment your TAM into a specific list of companies for specific people who have specific challenges

Step-by-step video in the comments section of how to do this right =G=G

4) Email Copy

Most companies L

� Send a wall of text because you can't decide what matters between the 3 benefits you think are worth mentioning

Do this instead 

� Keep it between 75-100 words and mobile-optimized
� Use this framework: 1 email = 1 pain point = 1 benefit with 1 solution with 1 CTA

5) Dont update your technical infrastructure

Most companies L

� Buy 2 domains on their original domain and 10 email addresses

Do this instead 

� Setup SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to verify your sender identity to build trust with email service providers to achieve good deliverability

� Use custom domain tracking to see the actual open rates

� Buy 3 email addresses per domain and warm them up

If you do these, your emails will land in the inbox and never in the spam.

Find email addresses for your KDMs

Enroll them in a Smartlead sequence

In a space where everyone is sending emails daily at scale, heres how we stood out:

1� Estimating Monthly Order Volume & Qualifying Accounts

We leveraged AI to analyze product catalogs and categorize brands into their respective industries. 

By applying conversion rate benchmarks and integrating website traffic data from Store Leads, Semrush & Similarweb, we accurately estimated Monthly Order Volumes. This allowed us to efficiently qualify stores at scale using Clay.

2� Further Product-Based Qualification
Given that our client can only store specific product types, we employed AI to review full catalogs again. 

An AI prompt helped us determine if stores sell products that fit our storage capabilities. 

We disqualified stores selling items requiring freezing, custom personalization, and other non-ICP categories.

3� Weight-Based Product Disqualification

We crafted a GPT prompt to estimate product weights, disqualifying those that were too heavy for our storage requirements.

4� Assessing Shipping Experience

We scraped data to evaluate each companys shipping experience, categorizing them into four sequences. If their shipping experience was satisfactory, we didnt reach out. If it was lacking, we highlighted specific problems and offered our help to solve them.

5� Personalizing Outreach for Different KDMs

To effectively engage CEOs, VPs of E-Commerce, and Operations heads - each with unique goals and challenges - we developed a script to tailor every sentence and CTA for each persona.

=� Results

We identified companies with pains we could solve without SDRs manually qualifying stores and products. Our approach ensured that our emails were genuine and relevant, personalized for each persona, rather than blasting out generic messages.

As Clay experts, I think it's our responsibility to teach teams to embrace the new era of sales tooling, and not push back on it.

From enriching your TAM, through automating account scoring, to engaging website visitors automatically via email, there are plenty other use cases to discover.

< Here's how to use it to map out enterprise accounts for land and expand across multiple countries

1� Build list of existing accounts that you want to expand (A simple CSV with Company name and website URL will do)

2� Use Linkedin & Claygent to get all of their locations. There may be differences - better to use multiple data sources to verify the outputs.

3� Use Predictleads to list out their subsidiaries in your target markets.

4� Use Linkedin, Apollo, or any other data provider to find key decision makers in your target countries.

5� Set up different data providers to enrich your contact list with email address and phone numbers. Prospeo, Datagma, Dropcontact & Icypeas are a few we rely on regularly.



Now, you have your top existing customers, enriched with countries of operations, their office locations, key decision makers in those countries and contact details for your account team, ready to use.

urn:li:activity:7196139444419063809,"Here's how we used Clay to qualify 10,000 accounts in 5 minutes

Account research and scoring is a huuuge burden on salespeople. 

You don't want your team to manually research and qualify them. You want your team to focus on what they're good at. Selling.

So here's how we automated this process with one of our biggest clients, who have a massive TAM of tens of thousands of accounts.

1. Website data

We built a custom integration the Similarweb API to get their monthly traffic and technologies being used. 

With formulas, we created separate columns to identify key competitors and technology partners.

Created a scoring logic with our client and built formulas for every data point:

- Their ideal customer has significant website traffic, so we automatically score their traffic into 5 levels, and assign a score on that

- if the prospect uses a competitor they historically had higher success replacing, we assign a higher account score

- If the prospect uses a number of technologies from their partner ecosystem, we assign a score on that too

2. Linkedin data

We identified their total employee headcount, identified the number of people that fit their buyer persona, company growth trend, and scored all of those data points based on their ICP preferences.

3. We used a combination of native integrations and scrapers to get the number of online reviews from platform list Google reviews, Yelp, and Trustpilot

4. Scraped the number of social media followers across Facebook, X, Youtube, and Instagram, aggregated all of those into an account score

5. Scraped their website to understand if they fit their ideal industry category, are they B2B or B2C prospects, and other key indicators of an ideal customer

So now taking a look at all of those data points, we have a clear picture of the prospect and 

We summarized all of those individual points we assigned on each data point, and aggregated into a top level account score.

What's left? Another custom HTTP API (one of my favorite Clay features) so that you can sync all of these newly acquired data points across your whole TAM with your CRM.

End result?

Sales is empowered with up-to-date data about their prospects, without having to move a finger, all in their CRM. Now they can easily identify which accounts to prioritize, at any given time.

They literally saved a year of manual work - all thanks to Clay and some creative automations.

=4 Pay per result
Only getting paid for meeting booked or lead generated. While I see how clients want to share the risk, a pay ONLY for results type of deal will attract the wrong type of clients who have little to no incentive to help you succeed. There are many moving parts outside of your control to confidently take on projects like these.

� Pay per hour
As an agency, it may seem you are selling services. But in reality, you're selling working hours of highly qualified individuals. It may be easier to sell an hourly rate than a fixed price in the beginning, but eventually, you should charge for value, not for the time you spend. Plus, when working for hourly rates, you're incentivized to work longer, not more efficiently.

=� Project based pricing
We're getting there. These can be lucrative, but can also turn into disaster when things take more time than initially projected. Properly settings expectations and scoping pronects will be key here.

=� Retainer
Harder to sell, but provide stability and generally higher lifetime value. In the beginning, you might sell in any of the previously mentioned models, and when the client is satisfied, turn it into a retainer.

Here are a few things that are essential to their outbound success:

1. What they're selling solves a very real problem for merchants

We turn down prospects fairly often because they haven't figured out what's working, what's their value prop, who they're selling to, etc. With Subscribfy's offer, prospects are actually interested in taking a call as we're reaching out with a relevant solution to their problem.

2. They're receptive to feedback

They point out if they have doubts/questions, but listen to our feedback as well. We regularly brainstorm together on how to improve the campaigns/copy/offer/etc.

3. They're super invested

We've set up a shared slack channel to notify us when new bookings / activity come in, and they immediately jump on the replies and celebrate new bookings with us together. It's this level of dedication that makes our collaboration feel like working within a single, unified team.

Before you pursue partnerships as a new revenue channel, make sure your direct sales strategy and sales process run smoothly. If you can't reliably sell it yourself, how can you expect a partner to do it well for you?

 Be patient

Partnerships is a long term game. There will be small early wins, but for it to become a predictable revenue engine, it usually takes longer than direct sales, 1-2 years minimum. 

=6 In the early days, do things that don't scale

No need to think about fancy tooling right off the bat. You don't need a PRM, enablement platform, or anything else. Your partners won't use it, trust me. Go lean, and only invest in the tooling when you've proved channel sales works for you.

To me, the holiday season is a synonym for planning and self-reflection. Taking account of how Ive done this past year and setting some new goals. This year has been quite a journey, filled with new experiences and learnings.

<
  Living Abroad

I finally realized my long-held dream of living in a new country this year. It's been a mix of challenges and triumphs, and I'm thrilled I took the plunge. My Spanish significantly improved, so now I can order not only 1 but 2 beers at once. <{ 


=V Minimalism 

I generally try to avoid having a lot of physical stuff in my possession. But still, things pile up after a while. With the relocation, we needed to ditch plenty of our clothes, furniture, appliances, etc. We moved across the continent with our car. Its not exactly a backpack lifestyle, but if you give it a try youll realize: theres only so much you can fit in a car. = 

I want to live a life where I can be happy without a lot of unnecessary purchases, and this trip helped me with that. 


=� Entrepreneurship

Ive always had an entrepreneurial side, but I wasnt fully embracing it. This year, I tipped my toe more than I initially planned, but I enjoyed the journey. I'm learning something new every day, working with exciting clients, so this is something I wish to continue in 2024.

 
=� Financials
I tried to focus on net worth instead of how much I make. Our households net worth doubled compared to last December. I dont want this to become my primary measure of success, but at the end of the day, were all working for money.

I try to look at it more as an indicator that our skills are valuable and sought after in todays market.


Though I didn't have a strict list of goals for the year, it's been a fulfilling ride. I'm now looking forward to being more intentional with my goals in 2024.

How about you? How did your 2023 go? I'd love to hear your stories and reflections! =G Let's share our experiences as we gear up for another promising year. <",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7145451698403131392,,1 year ago,janivrancsik,ACoAAAyVlXMBT484Y_KLDJqBYrRXUvNb9emEq9I,Jani,Vrancsik,"Enterprise Clay Partner agency founder | Sales leaders: I'll help you build a scalable outbound engine that gets meetings booked on autopilot in the next 180 days | DM me ""outbound"" to learn more",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQG4wUDYCvLAGA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1722000838707?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=1uEs2HotqNDTDigOSconu4RW7Z62vFN8uVF9pHIFTzM,1.0,,,,,True,No,No,No

Startups, with limited resources:
- they want to focus on product development, and can't afford to have any engineer work on their website
- but want to look bigger with great design to attract customers and investors
- product-market-fit may be lacking, so messaging changes by the minute

Established companies:
- they have a custom-coded website, but dev and marketing teams are always fighting to make changes
- as good engineers are a scarce resource everywhere, still don't want to assign engineering hours
- custom solution isn't scalable

Do any of these challenges sound familiar? I've bet on Webflow as the primary tool for building websites because it allows us to solve these challenges incredibly well.

One of the most common career mistakes I've seen - been sooo guilty of this plenty of times - is just doing your job and keeping stuff for yourself.

Made progress on a project? Make some noise about it.

Closed a deal? Share the win internally.

Helped a customer immensely and got great feedback? Be proud of it.

Launched a new feature? Go and present at the all-hands.

Call it internal marketing, advocacy, or blowing your own trumpet. Doesn't matter.

Career progression comes from recognition. It's good to recognize your own impact, but others have to recognize it too.

Custom Instructions.

If you use it on a regular basis, I'm sure you're sick of the first few responses you get. You always have to iterate, rephrase, add more details, make it shorter, etc.

Custom Instructions are the Advil to this headache. Alleviate some of these recurring issues. 

Here are some good examples of what you can do:
- Never mention that you're an AI
- Never suggest seeking information from elsewhere
- Keep responses unique and free of repetition
- If a mistake is made in an earlier response, recognize it and correct it
- Provide multiple solutions and ideas when possible
- Cite credible sources to support your reasoning, provide links if available
- If a question or ask is unclear, ask follow-up questions and ask for more details to confirm your understanding of the task before answering

You only have to set these once in your settings, and these instructions will be considered in new conversations

urn:li:ugcPost:7335666464475013124,"There are thousands of AI Sales tools out there. Here are 5 you should be using:

1. n8n

N8N is far and away the best general workflow tool I've ever used. It feels like the possibilities are absolutely endless in what you could create with it, and the UI is incredibly intuitive for anybody who has used tools like Zapier and Make before. The AI integrations are UNREAL. You can create agents using any AI model, trained on your own data, in minutes. 

2. Lovable

Lovable is at the forefront of vibe-coding, specifically for assets like web apps, dashboards, graphic design assets, and more. They've skyrocketed to $60M in ARR for a reason. You can create unbelievably valuable software just by using plain english, and the benefits for sales teams here are huge. Check out my recent post using it to create software at scale, pinned in my profile. 

3. Exa

Exa's product, or something like it, is the future of lead sourcing. For years, our minds have been constrained by basic filters for creating lead lists. Exa allows you to source your exact ICP using plain english, instead of having to use revenue and industry filters to approximate who you're targeting. I highly recommend playing around with their websets tool. 

4. Anthropic MCPs

MCPs allow you to interact with any technology like it's an employee. Simply sent a command to your MCP server and perform an action, return data, or help create insights super easily. We use MCPs internally at The Kiln for campaign analysis, which help us quickly find new efficiencies in campaigns we otherwise would not have found via traditional dashboards. You may not know it, but you'll be using MCPs for nearly everything in a year or so. 

5. Clay

Anyone who follows this profile knows what Clay is already, but for those who don't, it's the best workflow and enrichment tool for sales teams on the market, bar none. It has better enrichment data than any tool ever, and this combined with powerful AI workflows allow you to create incredible things.

urn:li:ugcPost:7333192304679141376,"Clay just launched custom signals. Here are my thoughts:

1. They're super powerful if used correctly.

Signals have been a popular GTM buzzword for a while, so almost everyone knows that they can work well. However, the difference with Clay's signals are that you can create ones that competitors aren't. Every company with a mature GTM team has been tracking the same 5-10 signals for years now. This unlocks some real alpha in a business' GTM strategy, because their creativity isn't nearly as limited by technological constraint.

2. They subtly exposes the tech behind signals, and will likely lead to a lot of signals companies going out of business.

This is the ultimate example of ""your product is a feature"" being put into action. Companies (I wont name names) used to package signals as this magical box that outputs interesting information that you can action upon. Now, it's pretty clear that every ""signal"" is just an API call to a data provider with a dedupe mechanism built into it. Honestly, I'm glad Clay indirectly exposed how this was done, as it makes ideating relevant signals much more accessible.

3. For existing Clay users, this is essentially just a credit saving mechanism. 

You could pretty much do the custom signals thing in Clay before this feature released, using scheduled enrichment runs. The only difference is that now, you only pay for new results- before, it would cost you a credit per row per search, regardless of whether new results turned up.  Saves a ton of credits, and makes signals more financially feasible for larger data sets.

urn:li:ugcPost:7328835266528358401,"Its crazy that companies still assume they have to choose between writing highly personalized emails that take hours, or automating outreach that gets ignored.

There are tools out there now that make it truly easy to that blend relevance and scale without compromising either.

At The Kiln weve been building outbound campaigns for our clients that feel bespoke for each lead, but are actually powered by systems on the backend that let us move fast. 

One recent example involved an e-commerce client where we enriched their account with real-time site speed, monthly traffic estimates, and average product pricing directly from their storefront.

From there, we crafted messaging that tied performance to revenue  showing how a one-second improvement in load time could result in thousands of dollars in additional monthly sales. The email didnt just look personalized  it was grounded in data they could verify themselves, and it connected to a real business outcome.

This works because it uses publicly available data that tells a clearer story  one that the prospect already knows, but hasnt yet connected to what youre offering.

The takeaway for anyone struggling with outbound is to stop treating personalization as a novelty and start treating it as a way to deliver value upfront. 

With the right tooling and workflows in place, this level of relevance is absolutely possible to achieve at scale.

Everyone knows the problems. But few have found a reliable solution to deal with these issues.

At The Kiln weve been implementing Clay across enterprise clientsand Ive seen firsthand how it addresses all 5, head-on.

I thought it would be fun to break each one of them down, and outline how Clay can help:

1. Missing or incomplete data

91% of CRM records are missing essentials like job titles or phone numbers (LeanData).

Using Clay: Waterfall enrichment across 75+ data sources. If one source cant find a detail, Clay automatically checks the next. No dead ends, no manual patching.

2. Outdated or Incorrect Data

CRM data decays fastup to 70% annually.

Using Clay: Automated refresh cycles that proactively re-enrich stale records on a set schedule. You define the timing. Clay handles the updates behind the scenes.

3. Duplicate Records

Duplicate contacts and accounts create confusion and kill productivity.

Using Clay: Pre-ingestion deduplication. Before new data hits your CRM, Clay checks for existing matches and flags or merges themsaving downstream cleanup.

4. Poor Lead-to-Account Matching

Bad routing leads to slower follow-up and lost opportunities.

Using Clay: Enriches leads with firmographic signals (domain, employee count, industry, etc.) to associate them to the right accountsimproving match rates and routing accuracy.

5. Lack of Standardization

Inconsistent formatting breaks workflows and analytics.

Using Clay: Custom field-level formatting rules applied at the point of enrichment. Job titles, phone numbers, and industries are standardized automatically.

Most RevOps teams are dealing with the same CRM data issuestheyre just handling them manually or retroactively.

Clay lets you fix these problems at the source.

And when implemented well, it makes your entire GTM system faster, cleaner, and more reliable.

Were seeing it firsthand across the enterprise clients we support at Kiln.
Let me know if you want to dive deeper on any of the use cases.

Everyone loves the idea of uncovering whos visiting their site&

But most teams struggle with what to actually do with that data.

You get insights like:

- Whos visiting
- What pages theyre viewing
- How long theyre sticking around
- But raw intent data is only valuable if you can act on it.

So I broke down how we take this type of data and turn it into high-converting outbound  in a repeatable, scalable way.

Heres the play:

1. Push the data into your workspace
 Start with the essentials  company, contact name, title, LinkedIn URL.

2. Filter for ICP + decision-makers
Run logic to confirm:
Is this a B2B company?
Is the contact a decision-maker?

3. Enrich missing fields
If the contact email is missing, use waterfall enrichment to fill the gaps with verified data.

4. Personalize the outreach
Scrape recent LinkedIn posts
Check for relevant keywords (e.g. AI, growth, etc.)
Generate a custom first line referencing their content

5. Add buying signals
Layer in signals like:
New role
Actively hiring
Recent funding

6. Run a tailored AI prompt
Use AI to read their company description and generate 23 use cases specific to their business.

7. Add a personal touch at scale
Generate a custom image with their profile picture and a personalized message  all automated.

Once its set up, this becomes a self-running, personalized outbound engine.

We have a program over at The Kiln where we try to stretch the boundaries of what's possible with Clay by building example tables to show enterprise companies that we think are cool. 

In this case, we did it for Semrush, using their own integration with Clay. Akansh Gupta and Elias Stråvik put their brains together and created a masterpiece.

Here's what the table does:
- Scrapes a list of local businesses using Google Maps and Serper, then writes them to a new table
- Uses the Clay x Semrush integration to find traffic analytics for each company
- Takes a screenshot of the prospect's website and uses Imagga to find the site's main colors
- Uses Claygent to find the frequency of core SEO keywords on the prospect's site
- Finds the prospect's sitespeed analytics
- Then, connects to a template that Akansh vibe coded in Replit that references all of this data in a custom dashboard for the prospect.

Clay is at the heart of this shift. 

Instead of hiring five SDRs to handle research, enrichment, and outreach, one person can now run that entire motion as a workflow. Use job change or hiring signals to surface leads, enrich with Clay + LinkedIn + Clearbit, pull in tech stack and intent data, and push to Apollo or Instantly for automated outreach. The pipeline refreshes dailyno manual work required.

Same goes for marketing. 

One RevOps-savvy marketer can now do the work of three: auto-segment demo requests by ICP score, trigger email flows based on title or source, and build outbound lists from community and event activityall powered by Clay, Zapier, and a few other tools.

The leverage goes beyond sales and marketing. 

Customer Success can trigger onboarding based on usage. Recruiters can auto-source based on job changes. 

Partnerships can find net-new targets by geo and hiring data. Product-led teams can flag active users and route them to AEs in real-time.

urn:li:activity:7312825540220997632,"Heres how demand gen marketers should be using Clayif they want to get promoted  

Not for cold outreach.

For running real-time lead scoring and routinginside Claywithout waiting on RevOps.

Heres the exact setup =G

1. Capture leads + enrich them in real time

Most teams wait until leads hit the CRM before scoring or enriching.

Thats too late.

In Clay, you can trigger enrichment the moment a lead enters the system.

Heres how we set it up:

New lead enters via form or event

Clay enriches with:

Job title, seniority

Company size, industry

Location, funding, hiring signals

2. Score leads directly in Clay using logic blocks

Once enriched, we apply custom logic to segment leads.

Examples:

Is job title Director+ AND function is Demand Gen or RevOps?

Is company B2B AND >50 employees AND funded in last 12 months?

Is domain verified AND company HQ in North America?

Based on the outcome, leads are scored + labeled accordinglyinside Clay.

3. Route based on outcome

Now that weve scored it, we take action:

High score ’ trigger outbound flow or push to sales

Mid score ’ assign for manual review

Low score ’ flag for nurture or suppress from paid retargeting

All logic-driven. All automated. All within Clay.

Why this matters?

You reduce SDR time wasted on low-fit leads

You increase speed-to-lead for high-fit accounts

You give marketing full control of lead quality and routing

And most importantly!

 You stop waiting on RevOps to build lead scoring models for you.

Demand gen marketers who know how to build logic + scoring flows in Clay will outperform those who just generate MQLs.

They move faster. 

They own more of the funnel.

They drive more demand!

They get promoted faster!",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7312825540220997632,,2 months ago,patrickspychalski,ACoAACm96PwBL6gGF2QqD5ak4jITm4uafP1ysy8,Patrick,Spychalski,Co-Founder @ The Kiln | A Clay Agency,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQFAdkgyh2lVLQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1712236093409?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=02FEPNX51f2eDaLdgfHz8y8f68sLTeTRZvt1R2yMESc,1.0,,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes

Step 1: Pull your first 50,000 leads

-Set your targeting criteria in Clay  industry, headcount, tech used, etc.
-Run the search- Youve now got your first 50K companies (with names, domains, LinkedIn profiles, and descriptions) for free.

Step 2: Rerun the searchbut exclude your first batch

-Then rerun the exact same search criteria.

Clay will now give you a new batch of net-new companies  completely free.

Its not that you dont have enough  its that what you do have is shockingly bad.

Over the weekend, I went deep on CRM data quality (as its something we are actively solving for many companies at The Kiln)

Here are two stats that genuinely blew me away:

1520% of all CRM records are duplicates.

Enterprise data decays at ~30% per year  meaning nearly a third of your CRM becomes outdated every single year

Let that sink in.

The average enterprise is aggressively pumping more contacts into their CRM, but barely doing anything to clean, enrich, or maintain whats already there.

Which leads to:
- Reps wasting time on dead leads
- Marketing targeting outdated personas
- RevOps flying blind on reporting

Thats why Im incredibly bullish on how Clay can solve this.

- Continuously enrich existing records with live data
- Identify and dedupe across sources in real-time

Enterprise GTM teams are dealing with:
-Bloated tech stacks that dont talk to each other
-Incorrect and outdated data slowing down RevOps
- Inefficient outbound workflows that limit scale

Here are the common objections I hear from enterprise teams around Clay and why they are wrong imo:

Its too difficult to learn.

Sure, theres a learning curve. But how are your reps operationalizing legacy tools like ZoomInfo today? Most GTM teams have hundreds of people making sense of data and systems, from SDR to Rev Ops teams and Sales Enablement. 

The beauty of Clay is once you figure out the basics (agencies can also help), it will be exponentially easier than before.

Its too expensive.

 Dont think about Clay as an added costits a replacement for multiple tools (data providers, enrichment tools, intent platforms, manual research). 

Enterprises end up saving money while improving efficiency. 

It wont work with our existing systems.

 Clay integrates into your current stack, automating workflows without requiring a full rip-and-replace. The best teams are using Clay to enhancenot replacetheir CRM and outreach tools.

Clay solves the enterprise GTM problem in ways most legacy tools cant:

- Consolidates GTM workflows  Centralizes prospecting, enrichment, and outreach in one place.
- Fixes the enterprise data problem  Automates enrichment and deduplication, reducing RevOps workload.
- Uncovers new opportunities  Surfaces high-intent accounts and contacts that traditional CRM setups miss.
-Makes personalization at scale actually work  Automates deep prospect research, making outreach both faster and more relevant.

Its a common misconception, I see on a daily basis, with people only referencing Clay when talking about their outbound process.

But the best teams are using it as part of their Rev Ops stack to fix bad CRM data.

At The Kiln, we see the same issues across companies CRMs:

 - Duplicate records
 - Missing firmographic details
 - Outdated contact info
 - Messy segmentation

Clay solves this by turning messy data into clean, structured, and actionable records.

In my opinion, Clay has three main superpowers when it comes to improving CRM data:

=9 Data Finding & Enrichment  Pulls accurate, real-time data from sources like HG Insights, and LinkedIn to fill CRM gaps.

=9 Advanced Data Segmentation  Uses AI to separate and structure fields (e.g., breaking full addresses into city, state, zip).

=9 Integrations  Syncs clean data across your CRM, outreach, and marketing toolswithout the manual work.

If you are a heavy user of Clay and have not yet introduced it to your Rev Ops team, you are doing them a disservice.

Was able to catch up with Paul Higgins a while ago to talk about exactly this!

But most arent.

A lookalike is a company that matches your best customer technographically- meaning theyre just as likely to get value from your product.

Heres how to build a high-converting lookalike audience:

1ã Use Ocean.io  Drop in your best customers URL, and it returns a list of similar companies.

2ã Filter by key criteria  Employee count, revenue, industry, etc.

3ã Enrich in Clay  Find key contacts at these companies for targeted outreach.

Once you have your list, messaging becomes easy. 

You already have case studies, data, and proofuse that in your outreach.

 No need to overcomplicate outbound.
 No need to guess who your next customer is.

Bonus: This works for positive cold email responses toofind lookalikes who responded, pull more contacts, and run similar campaigns.

If a profile at a company responds, chances are a larger list of similar roles will too.

Talked about this and more, with Ben Wright and the Sendspark team in an episode of the Everything is Dead podcast they just launched (full episode in comments)

And we used just four tools to do it!

TLDR: The issues

Before working with The Kiln, this client faced massive foundational issues with their outbound motion including: 

1ã Spam Cannon Outreach: Sending generic messaging to a broad audience with no clear targeting.

2ã Low Email Deliverability: Poor email infrastructure meant low open rates and limited reach.

3ã Lack of Personalization: Outreach felt impersonal, making it hard to connect with prospects.

4ã Single-Channel Focus: Relying solely on email for outreach.

Heres how we refactored their outbound approach, and the tools we used to do it:

1ã Smartlead  For email deliverability =ç
We used Smartlead to warm up and monitor email accounts, ensuring high deliverability. This allowed us to reach our prospects more effectively and consistently achieve 50-60% open rates.

2ã HeyReach  For LinkedIn outreach <
We took a multi-channel approach by integrating LinkedIn outreach alongside email. Using HeyReach, we connected with prospects, resulting in 3-4x higher positive response rates than email alone.

3ã Clay  For data enrichment and personalization =
Clay allowed us to enrich prospect data and automate personalization based on real-time intent signals (e.g., recent posts, promotions, or news about the company). This ensured our outreach felt genuine and relevant.

4ã HubSpot For CRM and lead management =Ê
HubSpot was our central hub for managing leads, tracking progress, and analyzing campaign performance. This gave us full visibility into the pipeline and allowed us to optimize outreach in real-time.

urn:li:ugcPost:7298770702956941312,"How I Used MadKudu + Clay to Automate a 3-Tier Outbound Campaign  

Not all leads deserve the same level of effort.

Some need direct SDR attention.

Others fit a multi-channel campaign.

And some? Just need a basic email!

Heres how I used MadKudu and Clay to segment leads based on ICP fit and route them accordingly:

Step 1: Get the Work Email

Used Clay to find verified work emails.

This is critical because MadKudu requires an email to generate a lead score.

Step 2: Score Leads with MadKudu

Ran emails through MadKudus integration to get a Company Fit Score and key signals.

The score tells us how well each lead matches our ICP based on firmographics, past conversions, and revenue potential.

Added this score as a column in Clay.

Step 3: Route Leads Based on Score

 Tier 1 (Score e 93) ’ Sent to SDRs via HubSpot
These are high-value leads that match ICP perfectly.
Created contacts directly in HubSpot so reps could prioritize them.

 Tier 2 (Score 80-92) ’ Multi-Channel Campaign
Mid-tier leads go into a multi-channel sequence.
Used Clay to find recent news about the company.
Used OpenAI to generate hyper-personalized copy based on significant events.

 Tier 3 (Score < 80) ’ Scaled Email Campaign
Lower-priority leads dont justify enrichment spend.
Sent them into a generic but targeted email campaign instead.

Why This Works 

- Saves Clay credits by only enriching high-value leads.

=9 Keeps SDRs focused on the best accounts instead of wasting time.

=9 Uses AI + automation to maximize efficiency at every tier.

Outbound works better when you focus on quality, not just volume.

While building a lead scoring table for a client a week ago, I realized that most businesses generally score accounts on a few key data points, plus a couple custom ones specific to their offering.

Most people arent taking full advantage of social signals in outbound.

But theyre an incredibly powerful data source for generating high-intent leads.

Heres exactly how we use Trigify.io + Clay to turn LinkedIn activity into pipeline:

1. Track Social Signals

We set up a Trigify.io table to track a specific keyworde.g., Clay.

This pulls a list of everyone who has posted about Clay on LinkedIn.

2. Enrich & Score Leads

We push this list into Clay and enrich contacts at scale.

Then, we use Claygent (Clays AI researcher) to:

 Find company revenue (via ZoomInfo, Owler, etc.)without expensive subscriptions

 Categorize each contact into five buckets, based on ICP fit!

3. Filter & Outreach

Once scored, we filter down to bucket #1 (best-fit contacts) and run an enrichment waterfall to find emails & phone numbers.

Now, instead of spraying & praying, were reaching out to people:

 Already talking about our space
 At companies that match our ICP
 Prioritized by revenue & fit

Social signals ’ Prioritized leads ’ Higher conversion rates.

Outbound is way more effective when you start with intent.

The offer is the number one most important aspect of your outbound copy by far. People overlook this so much and it baffles me. If you have a good offer, you don't need personalization or fancy outbound tricks. 

In this case, an offer is defined by ""what are you giving this person in exchange for their interest or time?"", or more plainly ""what are you giving them to get on a call?""

A great way to figure out if your existing offer is good is to ask yourself whether you would TRULY be interested in what you were offering if you were on the other side of the interaction. If not, or even possibly not, then completely reconsider. 

To figure out a good offer, ask yourself, ""what is the best possible thing I could give away that is related to my product or service without losing money or taking too much time away from my team""? Then, get what you came up with, scrap it, and think of something better because people always sell themselves short on this exercise. 

A great example of this came from a client of ours who sold a UGC aggregation platform. Our offer was that in exchange for a call, we would give brand managers of major fashion companies a file with the past 90 days of content made about them from across the internet. It's a no brainer. 

2. Your targeting is off.

Three things can be wrong with your targeting- who you're targeting, how many people you're targeting, or where you're deciding to reach them. 

For how many - If you're blasting emails to a huge audience with no responses, segment down and make your copy more personalized to that segment. If you're reaching out to 50 people for a campaign, either spend more time per prospect or find a bigger audience to target.

For where - If you're using email and it's not working, try LinkedIn or cold calling. 

For who- this is likely PMF problem, and goes much deeper than outbound, so probably worth a lot more consideration than just a light change. 

3. Deliverability 

If you have anything lower than 40% open rates then every other outbound problem you have likely pales in comparison. 

Email is getting significantly harder to do, especially with the increase in policing from Google and Microsoft 365. 

Here are a few things you can do to try and remedy this:
- Hire a deliverability expert to audit your existing domains and/or create new ones
- Check for spam words in your copy
- Add spintax or personalization (via tools like Clay) to your campaigns
- Verify emails that you're sending to and do NOT reach out to catch-alls
- Use Microsoft or Gmail to create accounts and completely avoid private servers unless you exclusively own them and have everything else down

If youre using Clay and blowing through credits faster than you expected, this post is for you.

One of the biggest mistakes I see newer Clay users make is enriching contacts before they need to. 

Heres how it happens:

You create a company or person-level list  

You preview the first 50 rows  

Without checking further, you run an AI integration on the entire listonly to realize later it wasnt what you actually needed L 

But heres the thing, Clay gives you a free ""gut check"" option  before you spend credits, specifically on integrations that require an LLM.

Instead of enriching immediately, just click ""Continue for Free""

This populates all the fields in the table without charging credits, so you can:

Visually review the entire dataset.

Spot errors, refine your inputs, and ensure the data looks right.

Save money by avoiding unnecessary enrichments.

Its a simple step, but it can save you thousands of credits every month.

I've been getting asked by clients and prospects alike as to where it should be, what it should look like, and how to use it. 

In short, the source of truth should, in my opinion, still be HubSpot, Salesforce, or whatever CRM you were using before. 

But here's the main difference- adding Clay as the layer beneath it. 

Before adding Clay as a layer underneath the source of truth, you'd be forced to deal with annoying, unstructured data that flowed directly through via your marketing techs. Now that Clay is the data intermediary, it acts as the structural verifier under the CRM. 

This added layer allows the team to like, actually use your CRM instead of assuming that everything in it is wrong or outdated. Clay updates existing CRM records, those records flow back into Clay to refresh the data periodically, and you actually can use your source of truth.

This strategy has been working particularly well for SaaS clients of ours that want to find high-intent leads. 

The idea is to look for job descriptions that:

Mention your competitors tech in them

Mention keywords related to the service you provide (for example, if youre Nooks, youd look for words like cold calling)

Mention tech that integrates with yours (for example, if youre Clay, look for Salesforce)

Why this works:

When companies are actively hiring for these roles, it signals that theyre focused on solving challenges your product can address. 

Its like getting a shortcut to high-intent leads.

Heres how you can replicate this:

1. Use Clay to scrape LinkedIn job postings  
2. Set up a table with the Find Jobs input. 
3. Add relevant keywords tied to your product or value proposition. 
4. Generate a list of companies hiring for these roles, along with hiring manager details.

How do you use it? It's simple, you target your competitors' customers.

It just takes a few minutes to do 

The TLDR:

Clay recently launched an integration with HG Insights, giving you access to powerful data like tech stack information.

This means you can easily identify companies using competitor technologies inside Clayand then build hyper-targeted outbound campaigns that convert.
Heres how you can run the exact same workflow

Step 1: Build your list in Clay

Start by creating a table in Clay with the HG Insights integration.

Use filters to tag companies using a specific competitors technology.

(For example: If Im doing outbound for Close, Id target HubSpot users.)

Step 2: Enrich the data

Enrich your company list to find the right roles at each account.

(For Close, wed target RevOps or Ops professionals.)

Step 3: Write copy that speaks to pain points

Now you have a hot list of companies that use your competitor's technology. 

Heres where it all comes together:

Base your outreach copy around your competitive differentiators

Highlight specific pain points you solve better than the competitor.

Include case studies from customers whove switched from the competitor to your solution.

Use personalized video (with tools like Sendspark) to showcase how your platform beats their incumbent provider.

By combining relevance (you know what theyre using) with personalized, value-driven messaging, you create outreach that actually lands in your prospect's inboxand their calendar.

urn:li:activity:7289717203594084353,"Adam Robinson thinks Clay raised too much money. I disagree. Here's why:

TLDR for those not caught up- Adam is having Varun Anand on his show tomorrow to grill him about the recent raise. He claims that there wasn't any point bringing in more money since 1) They haven't even used any of the $40M from the last round and 2) This makes the threshold for a positive outcome even higher than before. 

Here's my reasoning on why this is a good idea, from both Clay's perspective and from their investors. 

1. Clay's a rocketship. Rockets need fuel. 
I don't care that Clay hasn't spent the last $40m of funding they raised. They will at some point, and when that time comes, they'll need to raise anyway. 

There's no reason for them not to raise that now while the market is up, and also while investors think they're worth a 40x multiple. Why would they wait for the VC hype to die down (hype doesn't = actual product utility btw, which increases by the day in Clay's case) so they can give away more equity for the same amount of money?

Plus, now they have $40m to do whatever they want with, maybe they'll throw it in an S&P index or something until they need it lol. 

2. Clay's still undervalued. 
The only reason Clay's valuation isn't higher is because their revenue is allegedly much lower than it should be at this level of hype and notoriety. Every other AI tool as popular as Clay is at $100m+. This problem, relative to a demand problem, is way easier to solve. 

The investors have met the Clay team and have realized the same thing I have, which is that their ARR is absolutely no reflection of their potential, which is the potential to be worth more than ZoomInfo's $3B market cap. This tool is unlike anything the GTM space has seen, which warrants a large multiple with the anticipation that Clay will figure their revenue numbers out. I think they will. 

3. Clay's fundraise announcements have become a GTM motion in of themselves
If you were on LinkedIn last week, I bet you had the same problem everyone else was facing- you couldn't scroll once without seeing Clay's funding announcement on your feed. 

That wasn't by accident, and it wasn't to stroke the egos of the founders (in fact, I'm not even sure if Kareem Amin's ego exists anymore). It's a massive awareness campaign for the business, solidifies their reputation in the eyes of enterprise prospects, and brings even more ARR into the business, which has acted as a sort of positive feedback loop. 

They get more money, a higher valuation, and more customers, all from a beautiful LinkedIn symphony orchestrated by Mishti Sharma, Bruno Estrella, Peter Kang and the rest of the uber-talented team.

urn:li:activity:7288564482111373312,"You dont always need an agency to figure out Clay. Heres how to tell when you do  

Due to people like Yash Tekriwal >, >¾Eric Nowoslawski and other great Clay creators, the tool is as easy as its ever been to learn. 

For certain businesses, Clay agencies just arent needed and whatever theyre looking to achieve can likely be done in house.

Here are the three main situations where I think companies should bring agencies in:

1. You want to be sure youre doing it right the first, second and third time. 

Clay has more nuance than a Dostoyevsky novel. This dawns on me every time Im training a team member, and they do something super intuitive that turns out to be wrong. Companies, of course, experience this same thing, especially when their entire job isnt implementing Clay. 

Agencies help mediate this by having best practices down from their thousands of hours of experience. Each of our clients also have several people working on a project- usually when a company implements Clay themselves, theres really one person overseeing everything. Putting that much cost and responsibility on a novice can be harmful, and some businesses just dont want to deal with that. 

2. You dont have time to learn it

Ultimately, most people can learn Clay with time. However, time isnt something that many companies have a lot of. If youre a full time team member running sales at a mid-market SaaS org, learning how to connect integrations to each other and do HTTP API calls is probably not a great use of your time. 

Clay agencies can expedite the implementation of the tool so you can get stuff built without much lead up time. Deadlines are a thing, especially in larger organizations. Most teams cant write off a fiscal quarter as a Clay planning period. They have things to build. Claygencies can help build them. 

3. You want a creative partner to unlock the parts of Clay you dont know about

The hard part about describing Clay is that it does SO much. This is great news, actually, because it means that Clay can be implemented in so many parts of an org. Without a deep understanding of the tool, sometimes its hard to know what can be done with it. 

Most people start using Clay for a single use case- outbound, inbound, data cleaning, etc. Finding those other use cases takes a fair bit of time without agency assistance. Working with a strategic partner can be fun too- you can just have them dump ideas on you and pick the ones that sound interesting. 

Hopefully this is helpful to why they add value, and also why you may not need one if youre ready to dive into the tool yourself!

When you go to enrich a table you will have a variety of providers automatically suggested with Clay credits used next to each.

Simply reordering providers, and removing providers that are potentially double or triple the credit number used, can get more miles out of your monthly Clay credits and save you money.

Previously, this was only possible to do with a tool such as Builtwith, and the only way you could do it in Clay was by importing a massive list of companies and filtering down using their tech stack integration.

Alex Lindahl - His newsletter is an incredible resource for anybody wanting to learn more about Clay. He also posts ridiculously valuable LI content on a regular basis. One of Clay's best

Maja Voje - her frameworks for GTM rival the best in the business and she is truly one of the greatest minds in the space. Her coaching has transformed The Kiln and probably can for you as well. 

Michel Lieben >à and Alex Vacca >à=à - these guys run the agency social media game and I envy their content distribution daily. They also have a really well-structured course on how to use Clay that has great reviews.

=0 Jen Igartua - every time I hear her speak I learn something. One of the best minds in modern GTM and RevOps and also just way cooler than pretty much anybody I know in this space. 

> Jacob Tuwiner - great at Clay and we actually worked together in the early days of the Clay agency space. He's moved away from outbound and exclusively works on CRM enrichment, and he's quite good at it. 

Max Mitcham - Sometimes he demos a flow on LI and I feel like it could have been a SaaS in itself. Wild stuff

Alex Fine<2 - he and his team somehow are really good at outbound and paid media at the same time. For those who have worked in both, you know there's not much skill overlap so it truly is a huge accomplishment. 

Xavier Caffrey - he his team have been killing it on socials (shoutout to Marielle C. for her work there as well) and have been OG's in the Clay space. They also have a ton of great testimonials on their site so I'm sure their outbound is killer too.

urn:li:ugcPost:7272285040410030080,"Does your offer suck? Here are 5 ways to stand out to prospects anyway:

Sometimes, your offer isn't great and factors outside of your control can prevent you from improving it. If you work in a commoditized space like insurance or recruiting, giving a prospect a free and relevant value add that ties directly into your offering can be tough. 

In that case, it may be a better approach to send something that stands out. As I always say, if your offer is trash, you need to supplement with personalization. I wanted to list a few methods that can help you do that:

1. Personalized videos 
For obvious reasons, videos are generally more engaging than plain text emails. If your traditional messaging isn't working, send your prospects a video that deviates from the mean. In the video, I show Sendspark, a tool that allows you to send personalized videos at scale. 

2. Personalized images
Tools like DynaPictures are awesome for sending custom images. I'm particularly a fan of this if you can use pictures to demo your product in action for a specific company. We used it to create mockup ads in CVS for one of our prospects and the result was 6 figures in pipeline. 

3. Custom landing pages
I think these are usually overhyped, but in specific cases (particularly products that are complex and require a fair amount of explanation), custom landing pages are a good option. We actually created our own micro-saas that does this for clients over at The Kiln, but if you're looking for a more out of the box solution, Tofu could be what you're looking for. 

4. LinkedIn voice messages
The open rates on these are insane, and if you use La Growth Machine to send them, they're sent in the same format as a native LinkedIn voice message. Pretty awesome. We've had more success from this method than the others by a fair amount. 

5. Gifting
Prospects are almost never going to think worse of you when you send them a gift. It's a great way to get their attention, and if you use the right tooling you can even make them custom to their interests. If you're serious about doing this, Sendoso is by far the best option. If you're doing this as a one off and in a less personalized way, Goody is a solid choice as well.

The only thing that really changes, if you have your systems set up correctly, is the source- for inbound, your marketing initiatives provide the leads, and for outbound, list building does. 

Other than that, you can run a matured inbound AND outbound motion using three to four tools - a lead source, Clay, a sequencing tool like Reply, and a CRM like HubSpot or Salesforce.

2. The lead being added to the table triggers an Ocean.io integration that finds ten lookalikes of the closed prospect.

4. From there, the lookalikes are put through a competitor check with Claygent to make sure they're worth actually reaching out to.

urn:li:activity:7265746402939473920,"Clay just announced their partnership (and integration) with Dynamics 365. Here's why I think it's a signal for something huge:

Honestly, when I first saw this announcement I was pretty underwhelmed. I was like, oh cool, another integration with a CRM. Not much of a change here. 

My immediate next thought was, I'm very wrong actually. As a matter of fact, this is the largest signal to date that Clay will soon become the obvious industry standard for data enrichment across the board. 

A partnership with Microsoft is not something to be overlooked. It's one thing to have an integration with a CRM, it's another to be the go-to enrichment platform for a CRM. Microsoft certainly doesn't take partnerships like this lightly. I'd have to imagine that the level of data quality and platform maturity required to get a partnership like this launched is unreal, and I'm honestly convinced Clay is the only one worthy of doing it. 

Companies pay obscene amounts of money for good data. ZoomInfo has a $3B market cap and their data isn't even that good. Now imagine a platform that can intake all of your data automatically, enrich it using the best aggregation of data sources available, and send it back to your CRM completely structured the way you want it, without having to do anything. That platform exists, and it has a partnership with Microsoft now. 

If I'm one of Clay's investors I'm preemptively sending them a bottle of champagne that would drown a whale, because it's a sign that they're next up in a big way.

urn:li:activity:7265008719002845186,"Clay has been slowly de-ranking automated outbound as one of its core use cases. Here's why I think it's a good idea:

As background, for everyone who's been in the Clay-verse for a while, you know that the main use case in the beginning was being able to send automated emails/messages at scale. 

I would argue that it's still incredible at doing this- we do it every day for our clients with great results. 

However, the ability to do this successfully is becoming more and more difficult for the average user. Deliverability issues, copy shortcomings, and other factors get in the way of success- then people blame Clay for it. 

The problem is almost certainly not Clay, it's your strategy, and with cold outbound becoming more commoditized, it's tough to have a good strategy. 

Use cases like CRM enrichment, TAM sourcing, and lead scoring are much less trivial for Clay, and when you're trying to build a $10B company, you want to focus on the things that EVERYONE can do well with the product, not just the upper echelon of subject matter experts. 

On top of that, most companies don't want to shift from the SDR model, especially on the enterprise side. Automating something like CRM enrichment is far simpler to demo, and still a massive value add. 

In short, I think it's the right move, and we've been offering tons of inbound, CRM, and scoring based stuff over at The Kiln as a result. 

Also, you should still absolutely use it for automated outbound. Like, it works.

urn:li:activity:7262479139553570819,"I had the opportunity to speak on a panel at TiECon Canada last week, and one of the attendees asked a really important question:

""With AI evolving so rapidly and potentially encroaching on our jobs, what is the best way to retain job security and ensure that I'm ahead of the curve?""

I had a very short answer to this- start learning tools and stop learning hard skills. 

This might be a hot take, given that hard skills are necessary for any given role, but frankly, AI will soon be able to do nearly every hard skill better than people. 

Think about what it's already done with sales- the entire landscape of how to sell efficiently has been changed by AI and the tooling that comes with it. Email copywriting, prospecting, researching, outreach, lead qualification, follow ups- almost all of this is either fully or partially being replaced by AI now. 

My advice was to think of every skill that's required to do your job, and then see where AI development stands in replacing that skill. If it's even somewhat close, start learning the tools that are at the forefront of replacing it. These tools can't run themselves, and the people that learn them will probably get paid even more than the people in the current roles that said tools are replacing.

Definitely interested to hear people's thoughts on this!

It's something pretty much every company over $10M ARR needs - an automatic lead research document generated the second somebody engages with you.

Here's the breakdown:
- When someone engages with marketing content, the lead imports into the Clay table via webhook. 
- Claygent finds the person's LinkedIn, then enriches to get their profile data
- We then get their LinkedIn followers, current job, past three jobs before that, company domain, summary, industry, revenue and more.
- Then, we categorize them into one of three ICP sectors using Claygent. 
- Based on the segment, we assign the appropriate SDR to handle the lead. 
- Then, we generate reasoning on why the prospect fits that segment. 
- We also generate 3 ways the prospect could benefit from your product.
- Then, we generate a Prospect Summary Google Doc using the information, and send a Slack message to the SDR with the link to the Doc.

urn:li:ugcPost:7260322432853458945,"We built a system that enriched a client's Salesforce instance in 1 hour. Here's how we did it:

Our client (a well-known company with strict name usage restrictions =) had an insanely unorganized Salesforce. 

Some of their problems included:
- Data from years ago that hadn't been updated
- Blank space where super important data (job titles, company names, etc) were completely missing
- Unorganized data that hadn't been put in the right field
- Data that hadn't been normalized (for example, the company's location was just one field instead of city, state, etc.)

Luckily, you can build a Clay table to do this entire thing. Here was the process:

1. Connect the client's Salesforce account to Clay (if you're an mid market or enterprise company, we recommend you create a separate OAuth to add the correct restrictions
2. Put every SFDC record you want updated into a list view
3. Create a table in Clay that imports the list view (they have an SDFC integration for this)
4. Build out the enrichment, normalization, and blank-space filling flow in Clay
^ this will always be different depending on what you're building, but in every case it will be a combination of enrichments, formulas, and conditional runs- quite a web!
5. Sync the data back to Salesforce using Clay's native integration

The best part is, the table updates every day with new records. Now your Salesforce can look good ~forever~

The tough part about defining Clay's possibilities lies in the fact that it's ridiculously versatile. However, there are 4 main categories:

1. Outbound/ABM
- Source leads from essentially anywhere using their native sources, webhook connections, or chrome extension that can scrape websites
- Enrich outbound leads for any data point possible. Like, if it can be found in a database or anywhere online, it can be found with Clay. 
- Personalize outbound better than any other tool, partly due to the fact that you have better data from the previous point

2. Inbound
- Connect all of your inbound data into Clay to use as a source of truth
- Enrich inbound prospects for more data than what you get from your marketing initiatives
- Automatically qualify inbound and send the qualified prospects to the appropriate database or sequencing tool 

3. RevOps Work
- Detect and purge all outdated CRM data 
- Automatically keep all of your Hubspot and Salesforce data up to date
- Enrich existing CRM contacts for better scoring and overall data accessibility
- Score CRM contacts for better lead routing 

4. General Automation and Enablement
This use case is broad, but Clay has a ton of other usage outside of GTM. Clay's team uses it for programattic SEO blogs, social tracking, and more.

It was an absolute gold mine, and he had what was essentially an unlimited source of leads coming from inbound marketing initiatives that he had set up earlier- they were gifts that kept on giving.

Common Room acts like Clay in the sense that it can aggregate data from several different providers for you to act on.

urn:li:activity:7254491569255333888,"We generated ~$14m of pipeline in three months for one of our clients.

Here's how we did it:

Background: Our client had a super high ticket offer, they were targeting decision makers at Fortune 500 companies, and they wanted a complete overhaul of their sales process.

The first thing we did was completely change their tech stack. They were using outdated legacy software (ZI, 6Sense, etc) to do their outreach, and their sender accounts were completely burned. This means that they had horrible deliverability, little-to-no personalization, and were sending at low volume.

To fix this, we spun up completely new sender accounts, switched the core tech stack to Clay, Smartlead and HeyReach, and voila, we had a system that was actually capable of high volume outreach.

Next step: We had to completely change their outbound strategy. Their past campaigns were sending long, templated, and unpersonalized outreach to every contact they could find on Zoominfo. Then they would send pretty much the same messaging 20 times to the same person and hope it worked.

To fix this, we overhauled their copy BIG TIME. The copy was so informal that I had to fight a little to get it approved, but I was confident it was the only way to potentially get the leads' attention. We turned a 10 step sequence with novels as emails to 4 super concise messages.

After that, it was time to experiment some channels. We tried the copy on email and we got a couple of bites, but not nearly enough to justify the channel. We actually planned to scrap the copy at first, but then decided to try it on LinkedIn. It went crazy, and suddenly we had an unreal amount of positive responses.

From there, all we had to do was scale the campaign!

You may have finished reading this and thought, wow, they really didnt do anything special. And honestly, I think thats the point. An effective tech stack, decent copy, and reaching your audience at the right place is more than half the battle. If done right, it can lead to massive results, like it did in this case :)

Lemlist recently launched a feature that lets you create outbound personalizations within the tool, and most of Tal's argument on why it's better than Clay was the ease of use. 

In his post (which you should check out), Tal talks about the feature, then walks through a flow that imports a LinkedIn profile into lemlist and then uses the LinkedIn data points to create a few base level personalizations. 

It's definitely easier to use than Clay, I'll give them that. However, it's just not nearly as powerful. Like, it's not close. Clay's enrichment capability in-platform allows for an infinitely larger amount of personalizations, and the relevance that they achieve is far better than referencing a company's description. 

There's a reason Clay has a learning curve. It's because it's open, powerful, and requires creativity to use. Clay could have easily created the same thing Lemlist did, but it would be sacrificing its entire moat, which is the ability to create personalizations that work, while using data that's hard to find. 

(and frankly, it's not that hard to learn, either. Yash Tekriwal >'s work on Clay University makes it even easier)

I'm a big fan of Lemlist's sequencing capabilities, but it'll never match Clay on this one.

Helium: Clay's most cost effective model- can be used for most tasks, especially those being run at high volume. A good balance of speed and accuracy. Costs one credit

Neon: Semi-complex tasks at a reasonable price point. If Helium doesn't work for your given prompt, try Neon and see if results are better. Costs two credits

Argon: Meant for deep research and complex analysis. Good for analyzing large texts, multi-modal info gathering, and anything that takes heavy thought. Costs three credits

In short, it can determine your ICP simply by inputting your website, and then configures a ""find people"" search based on the ICP it creates. 

Here's how it works:
1. You input your company's website
2. Clay scrapes your website to find any customer company you mention on the site (this includes logos- Clay's scrapers can identify the company simply from a logo image)
3. It then AI-generates an ICP for you based on the customers mentioned on your site
4. A people search is configured using the parameters generated by the AI, giving you an ICP lead list

For the user though, it's just all one click of a button! The feature is in beta right now, but it's worked completely accurately when I put in The Kiln's website.

From a high level, it's a way of securing leads, prospects, and ideally closed deals from partner companies. It works by sharing CRM data with partner companies in exchange for their CRM data. A nice barter system. 

Clay recently launched a source connection with Crossbeam, the leading nearbound tech on the market, who actually just merged with Reveal, which is how I found out about nearbound in the first place. 

This now means that you can import partner companies' CRM data into Clay, and then run an automated outbound campaign to them at scale. Exciting stuff.

urn:li:activity:7244339800336396290,"Do you refuse to hire agencies run by gingers? 

Here's how to run a successful top-of-funnel initiative without hiring The Kiln to do it:

Running outbound with new tools like Clay isn't actually that difficult when broken down, so here's how we do it from a high level. 

You need these three things to run a campaign:

1. A Lead Source- For cold B2B, use Clay, Sales Nav, Apollo.io, or Ocean.io. For local businesses, use Clay's Google Maps Integration. For warm leads, use PhantomBuster, Common Room, Trigify.io and RB2B. There's exceptions but for 95% of people these recommendations hold. 

2. An enrichment provider- Clay can likely do all of the enrichment you'd ever need. 

3. A sending tool. I recommend Smartlead for email, HeyReach for LinkedIn, anbd La Growth Machine for multi-channel. 

If you're running email campaigns, you need sender accounts. Use G-suite or Microsoft accounts for this. Don't use private servers to cut corners. Follow deliverability guides online to make sure you do it right. 

Ok, you have all the tech now. Next, you need to write the copy. 

No matter what channel you use, keep it short, to the point, and have a killer offer as the CTA. For LinkedIn, keep it even shorter. Personalize your first line using Clay's enrichments to find relevant data on the company that ties to your value prop. 

Your offer is the most important thing. If you don't have a good offer to provide, personalize your copy more to add relevant value. If your offer is incredible, get to the point, and don't waste your time and Clay credits personalizing. 

Make your sequences no more than 3-4 messages long, reframe the value prop in the second message, improve the offer in the third message, and breakup in the fourth. 

Test the copy on 500-1000 leads. If it doesn't get you a single positive response, iterate until it does. Set a threshold for success- I'd recommend between 100-350 emails per positive response as a range, dependent on TAM size. 

Once you iterate to success, scale your campaigns, then focus on using similar messaging for warmer leads. Run lookalike campaigns based on closed-won customers. Do CRM reengagement, social follower campaigns, scrape slack channels where your customers reside, etc etc. Find creative ways to deliver this messaging to customers at the right time. Your campaign type is the vessel for your offer, and the offer is the vessel for your product. 

That's pretty much it! There's more nuance to everything I assume, but from a high level this is how to win. 

You can now succeed despite your bigoted view towards the redheads of the world >Ñ<ü

1. Claygent
Developed by the illustrious Adam Eldefrawy, Claygent allows you to scrape the internet for essentially any piece of publicly available information. It's insanely powerful if prompted correctly, and it's getting better with each passing OpenAI model. 

2. Store Leads
If your target audience is in ecommerce, Store Leads is an incredibly robust and in-depth data provider on B2C stores. It provides you with SO much- social links, average product price, web visitors- the list goes on. 

3. LinkedIn
This one's obvious, but if you've never tried Clay before, it will still blow your mind to see all of that data in one place, especially in such an actionable format. 

4. PredictLeads
Shmuel Jacobsen recommended this for the list and I completely agree. They have data like company news, connected companies, tech stack, and other super hard to find data on companies that you probably couldn't even Google search if you wanted to. It's great, give it a try. 

5. Google
I think this one is great to try because it's a tool everyone uses, but Clay takes it to a new level by allowing you to search for things at scale and then action upon the data as well. If you know how to use Google search operators, this can be even more powerful.

Hope this is helpful!

urn:li:activity:7241464566398787587,"We're running a nurture campaign for one of our clients that's gotten positive responses from Amazon, Dell, Asus, Disney, and more. Here's how to do it for your company:

1. ACTUALLY make it a nurture campaign

The point of nurture campaigns are to legitimately form a relationship with the prospect on a good basis, not to sell your services to them the second you get on the call. Where most people go wrong is that they forget the objective is more long term, and try to make it a hybrid campaign that ends up being interpreted as a weak sales pitch. 

2. Use personal personalizations

I never recommend using personalizations that don't directly tie into your company's value prop.... unless you're running a nurture campaign. In this case, it's all about showing you did research on the person, not the company. With this campaign, we would look for one of three attributes on a person's LinkedIn profile (recent post, location, title) and make a comment on it. 

3. Keep it short, casual, and make your offer enticing. 

Just because you're not directly selling your product or services doesn't eliminate the need for the offer. In this case though, it has to be a personal offer. Dinner, coffee, virtual value exchange- something that the person will respond well to in an emotional sense, not just a value sense. We're reaching out to executives at Fortune 500 companies - they can afford dinner. They're showing up for the connection.

Adam Robinson and I agreed on our last webinar that the most commonly asked question about RB2B is, what do I actually do after I get my website visitors? 

Well, the short answer is, just do whatever effective outreach method you're using with your cold leads (with some changes based on landing page etc), but if you're looking for some inspiration, here are 5 ways to use RB2B to get more leads.

This video goes through levels 1-3, which from a high level, are:
1. Enriching website visitors and sending them to your CRM
2. Sending website visitors to a basic email campaign
3. Scoring website visitors for ICP fit and sending them to one of three campaigns based on their score, with some enrichments included

I highly recommend watching this if you're pretty new to Clay and looking to see how it interacts with RB2B. If you want to see the crazy stuff though, wait til tomorrow :)

urn:li:ugcPost:7237468666605293568,"This Clay table turns a list of leads into a credit-efficient GTM powerhouse =€

Clay's new MadKudu integration now opens up the capability of routing leads to specific channels based on an AI-assisted lead score. 

This means that you can save a ton of credits by only enriching, personalizing, and sequencing your highest priority leads, while still sending the lower-scored ones to a sequence as well. 

Here's the high level of how to use the table:
1. Create your custom lead scoring mechanism in Madkudu by training it on past customers and any other data you deem necessary for it to make an informed ICP decision on a list of companies
2. Import a large list of leads into a Clay table
3. Run the Madkudu integration to automatically score all of your leads using your company-specific AI scoring mechanism
4. Choose the channels you'd like to route your leads to (in my case, I chose SDR enablement in HubSpot, then a Multi-Channel Campaign in La Growth Machine, then a pure email campaign in Smartlead. If I was smarter, I would add HeyReach as well between LGM and SL)
5. Run any enrichments and create any personalizations you'd like to, and use conditional runs to make sure they're only run on prospects whose score fall within a certain range
6. Use conditional runs in Clay to route leads to the proper channel based on their score. In this table, I had all leads with a score of 93 or above go to Hubspot, any leads between 85 and 93 go to LGM, and then any below 85 to go to Smartlead. 

Voilà! Just like that, you've saved thousands of Clay credits and prioritized your leads to create a more efficient GTM team.

urn:li:ugcPost:7234186515398946818,"This new Clay integration will fundamentally change the way we score leads. 

The new MadKudu collab with Clay taps an advanced leads scoring tech that allows you to score leads at scale, but in a more effective fashion that increases conversion rates more than how it was traditionally done. 

The old way to score leads (as I'm sure most of you know), was defined by determining the data points you want to score by, then assigning scores to each interval of that data point (for example, company size being 10-20, 20-30, etc and assigning a score for each one). 

The hard part here was weighting the scores- you never knew if your lead scoring mechanisms were actually working because the scores you assigned them were arbitrary. 

The new way is using AI to determine whether a prospect fits ICP by taking a more all-encompassing approach. Madkudu does this by looking at residual data points associated with each lead and creating what is likely a better scoring system than you would have done manually.

Clay's new integration allows this to be applied at scale- however, it's worth noting that using Clay's API key will probably not do the trick. If you're going to use this integration, I highly recommend making a Madkudu account and creating your own ICP instead of the default one Clay uses.

Hope this is helpful!

urn:li:activity:7233828042329014272,"Here's an outbound tech stack I would recommend you consider for 4 different budget sizes:

DISCLAIMER: This is a generalized list. Many of the technologies listed in the higher budget ranges may be necessary even if you don't fall within that range, depending on what systems you're using.

Low Budget (<$300/mo):
- Clay
- Smartlead
- RB2B 

This gets you the basics, which is the ability to run a personalized outbound campaign at scale. 

Clay's lowest plan will give you enough credits to do the majority of enrichments and personalizations required for a basic campaign, and you can download the Clay table and upload it as a CSV to Smartlead. 

Clay also has more than enough with regards to lead sourcing where you likely don't need other databases for a basic use case.

Medium Budget ($300-$1000)
- Clay
- Smartlead
- RB2B
- HeyReach

With a higher budget, you can add two integral things to a matured GTM system, which are intent signals and additional channels. The reason I didn't add a dedicated multichannel tool here is because I still think it's important to prioritize volume when starting out, and keeping your sequencing tools separate allows for this. RB2B is one of strongest intent signals you can ask for, which is people literally visiting your website, and HeyReach allows you to expand your outbound efforts to LinkedIn as well. 

Somewhat large budget: ($1000-$2000)
- Clay
- Smartlead
- La Growth Machine
- RB2B
- Trigify.io
- Apollo.io
- Sendspark

This section just rounds out the benefits of the previous budget size- even more intent signals, even more channels, and an added lead source in Apollo which can help supplement some of the gaps in your TAM mapping. The addition of Sendspark helps send messages that stand out via a different communication medium. 

Unlimited Budget:
- Clay
- Smartlead
- Heyreach 
- La Growth Machine
- RB2B
- Sendspark
- Common Room
- Ocean.io
- Trigify.io
- PhantomBuster
- LeadMagic
- Apify
- Zapier
- Twain

Most businesses will run marketing initiatives of some kind, collect form submissions, newsletter subscribers, etc, and then give up after the prospect doesn't respond the first time. 

We've been seeing incredible results running re-engage campaigns for our clients' stale CRM leads, and honestly, I think everyone should do it. The steps are pretty simple too-

1. Go to Clay -> create new table -> import Salesforce/Hubspot Contacts

2. Find the list where all of your stale leads are housed, then import them to a Clay table

3. Write re-engage copy to send to your stale leads. We've seen basic, unpersonalized campaigns work (so you Clay beginners don't have an excuse to not run this). Even a 2-step sequence asking if they're still interested in whatever it was they engaged in can work. 

4. Create necessary personalizations in Clay, then use their Smartlead integration to sequence variables to your copy template

We realized before running our first campaign that we had all of the data needed for a classic ""do the math"" play- we were able to find their web traffic, their average product value, and their site speed all using Clay. 

Our first email (the one that converted really well), went something along the lines of (obviously written way better than how I'm about to say it):

""Hey John -- I noticed that your site speed is failing in essentially all metrics. 

Did you know that your conversion rates will increase by 17% if you improve site speed by 1 second?

Given ExampleCo's ~1,500,000 monthly site visitors, your average product price being $30, and assuming a conversion rate of 2%, this would mean ~$153k of extra revenue per month.

I'll install something for free that improves your speed by 20% in exchange for a call. Any interest?""

urn:li:activity:7227321098420326402,"Here's a general rule to follow when building campaigns around intent signals:

The weaker the intent signal, the more contacts you're going to be able to find, and the more emails you'll be able to send.

A great example: RB2B is an incredible intent signal as it shows that someone is directly interested in your products or services. However, the amount of website visitors that fill a form will obviously be lower, but thats a REALLY good intent signal. 

Conversely, the amount of people that were recently hired in a role that you're targeting (for the past 6 months, let's say) will be way higher than the amount of ICP website visitors you have. 

Why is this important? Well, you have to run a cost-benefit analysis on whether tools like Clay are worth it for specific use cases. If you have 2 ICP website visitors a week for a $10/mo product, it's not going to be worth paying $1k/mo for the tech stack required to automate an RB2B flow. You might be better off moving further up the funnel and trying a campaign there. 

The benefit of marketing-led outbound is that the volume of high-level intent signals increases significantly when funneling leads into a sales motion. Hubspot form fillers, website visitors, social media engagers- the list of possible campaign lead sources goes on and on.

- LinkedIn: Keep quality high while remaining consistent. Results can take weeks/months.
- Cold Email: Gaining trust from strangers. Flooded inboxes. Deliverability.

urn:li:activity:7334165423422111744,"The European SaaS Market is valued at ~$95B.

Some of its hottest success stories are in Sales Tech. Here are my favourites:

1/ FullEnrich <ë<÷

I had a chat with Benjamin after he exited his last company.

He mentioned launching a waterfall enrichment platform.
But everyone was telling him NOT to do it.

I told him: You should ABSOLUTELY do it. But if you do, focus on mobile numbers first!

This was 1 year and a half ago.
FullEnrich is at $4M+ ARR today.

And its the #1 platform I recommend for mobile phone enrichment.


2/ HeyReach.io <ò<ð

Starting out of Macedonia, Nick and his team first built a Reddit outreach platform.

When it seemed it wouldnt work, they pivoted to LinkedIn outreach.

Their big idea? Becoming the Instantly.ai of LinkedIn.

I remember thinking this was a great idea when I met the team (at < $500k ARR).

It took them 22 months to hit $5M ARR.


3/ Expandi.io <ó<ñ

Stefan, Expandis Co-Founder, is one of the OGs of Founder-Led Marketing.

He was publishing viral Twitter threads before it was cool, and popularised the trend of founders sharing valuable content to promote their companies (as opposed to pushing bland product updates).

Glenn & Stefan bootstrapped Expandi to $10M ARR, and it's one of the best LinkedIn outreach platforms today.


4/ Prospeo.io <ë<÷

Prospeo went from 0 to $1.5M ARR in 12 months.

The company was founded by Hugo & Jon (who sadly disappeared from LinkedIn). 

I love their success story because their email data has been powering my agency, ColdIQ, since the early days. 

It started with 5,000 monthly enrichments, all the way to 100,000 monthly emails found via Prospeo.


5/ lemlist <ë<÷

One of the most notorious French success stories& and the company ColdIQ gained the most inspiration from (plus, the platform we use for multi-channel outreach!).

Whether its Guillaumes Founder-Led Marketing playbook.
Or the way the lemlist team has historically dominated the LinkedIn feed&
Or even the way they restructured their executive team, now led by Charles...

I believe everyone should study their growth playbook - and youd quickly understand how they grew past $31M ARR, currently adding +$1M in ARR every month.


6/ Breakcold <ë<÷

Arnaud & his team are going after giants, with a CRM thats built for the era of social selling.

Whats most impressive to me is how Breakcold managed to make a name for itself in the B2B LinkedIn space, despite staying lean, bootstrapped, and spending very little.


7/ Instantly.ai <ê<ê

Raul, Nils & Reio have revolutionised the entire cold email industry when they came up with Instantly.

They set new norms by popularising concepts such as inbox rotation and by allowing smaller companies with low budgets to rival the sending volume of established larger enterprises. 

Theyre always one move ahead and ship features at an unreal pace.
It's the #1 cold email tool we use at ColdIQ.

urn:li:ugcPost:7333440362885103616,"How to get more replies from your LinkedIn DMs:

Based on the 150+ messages I receive weekly

BACKGROUND:

I sent > 2,000,000 prospecting messages for my $4,800,000+ ARR outbound agency.

But truth is&

I now spend more time answering DMs than running campaigns.

I run a 30-person company.

(Just imagine how much outreach 100+ people CEOs get)

I cant speak on their behalf, but I DO look at my inbox&

And I reply to cold DMs

(Not always very fast tbh)

Heres how I make the decision to respond or to ignore cold outreach&

And how I changed my outreach because of this “


 DMs that offer free work

I received DMs in which I was offered a free landing page rewrite.

As for the best DMs I got& people went as far as sending already-made work samples.

On our end, we ran campaigns offering custom leads lists.

(Spoiler: we had way more replies than we knew what to do with)

Pro Tip: Imagine you signed your prospect as a client. Think about the first think youd do if you were to sign them. And do it already (if it doesnt take too much time).


L Generic templated DMs

This (almost) never works. As soon as people realise youre sending the same copy-pasted template to everyone, theyll ignore you. Plus, how can you be relevant to people if everyone is getting the same message?!


 DMs asking to be referred to the right person

Say I get a message based on a current initiative of ours - and you did your research to know who on my team owns the initiative... Ill happily refer you to the right person.

Pro Tip: You can automate this ’ within Clay, by building a workflow that combines buying intent + finding a colleague in a relevant department.


L DMs asking for time on the 1st ever message

I try to minimize the number of meetings I attend weekly.

(Back-to-back meetings can be pretty draining)

If the first thing you do is ask for time, without context, Ill probably ignore you.


 DMs from well-known people

Its unfair, but WHO sends the message matters as much (if not more) as WHAT is the message.

If Im getting a message from a well-known founder, or an Exec at a large company& Im much more likely to reply.

Ive observed the same with my own campaigns; the more I grow on LinkedIn, the better my response rate.

Pro Tip: If your audience lies on LinkedIn, building your personal brand will massively benefit your inbound + outbound results.


= Videos

I dont always reply, but I always watch videos (cant help it!)

From what Ive seen, theyre usually grat at grabbing peoples attention.


= Voice Notes

Same idea as with videos& voice notes get me curious.

They create a pattern interrupt in peoples inboxes.

Some people hate receiving these& but that doesnt change the fact that theyre efficient at grabbing attention.

Pro Tip: lemlist has a feature that lets you scale voice note sending.

Thats about it&

urn:li:activity:7332716018743603200,"How we turned $37,178.62 in ad spend into $1,936,500 of pipeline for a 7-figure SaaS client:

We built a coordinated ABM campaign where outbound and paid media worked together.

Most teams separate the two:

- Marketing runs ads to cold audiences.
- SDRs reach out with messaging that doesnt reflect what buyers have seen.

The result?

Mixed signals. Low reply rates. Wasted spend.

Heres how we did it differently:

1. Built one unified target account list

Both outbound and ads worked off the same accounts, segmented by persona and funnel stage.

2. Ran persona-specific ad campaigns

We used:

- Document ads
- Thought leader ads
- Business case creatives

These educated cold accounts before the first email landed.

3. Tracked buyer intent

Using Fibbler + PhantomBuster, we monitored engagement across channels.

Outreach only started once signals appeared.

No cold spray. No guessing.

4. Launched outbound at precisely the right time

Once someone engaged with the ads, our outbound sequences began.

The result?

The messaging felt like a continuation, not a first touch.

After 90 days, the numbers looked like this:

- 216+ leads from outbound
- $2M in total pipeline
- $272,600 in closed revenue
- 7x ROI
- $1 ’ $51 in pipeline efficiency

Why did it work?

1. Ads created awareness and framed the value.
2. Outbound followed up with personalized messaging based on intent.
3. No channel worked in isolation, and every step felt connected.

Were now applying this synced ABM approach across more SaaS clients.

It added +$760,000 in new ARR last month to our agency.

Here's the breakdown “

1ã Lead Generation

~35,000 people visit ColdIQ's website every month.

To attract this traffic, we rely on:

A. LinkedIn Posts

³ Our team (170,000+ LinkedIn followers) posts a ton of educational content around prospecting, GTM & AI tools.

B. Paid Ads

³ We run LinkedIn Ads, Meta Ads & Google Ads. 

We budget around 10,000 to $20,000/mo to experiment on various advertising channels.

C. Cold Outbound

³ We constantly run prospecting campaigns based on various plays:

- Value-based (Lead magnet) campaigns
- Industry-centric campaigns
- Success stories Lookalikes
- Inbound-led outbound
- Social re-engagement
- Signals layering
- ...

At our scale of sending (1,000+ emails per day) we generate some traffic from these campaigns.

D. SEO

³ We have a couple of directories that rank well on Google. Plus, we write 4-6 articles per month for our blog. 

Around 10,000 monthly visitors come from organic search.

E. YouTube Videos

³ Alex, Dan and I started posting a few videos. 
Plus, we're launching ColdIQ's company channel soon.

Not much going on so far, but it already generates leads at ~1,100 subscribers. Watch this, we'll be ramping up the video content very soon.

F. Webinars

³ We do monthly webinars with Directors, CXOs & Founders at prominent GTM Tech companies.

Not great for traffic generation, but it works well at converting prospects.


2ã Lead Capture 

To better our conversion rates (number of meetings booked) we have:

- a one-field form signup that automatically enriches leads on the back-end

-  a lead magnet that pops up after 1 min of browsing the site

- a few CTAs to register for our newsletter. And gain access to our e-book.

- for visitors who take no action, we use de-anonymization platforms, score  & segment them using LLMs, and re-engage them via email or LinkedIn.


3ã Lead Conversion

95% of our deals are sales-led. 

They typically close through a Google Meet conversation with one of our sales reps. 

We schedule 1 to 2 closing calls depending on the offer, contract value, and individual buying process of our clients.

At the moment, we have over 70+ B2B clients on retainer. 

Plus 150+ students who bought our accelerator program.

This got us to $4.5M+ in ARR.

In your opinion, what should we do to hit $10M in ARR? =G

The one thing I did differently?
- It wasn't using fancy tools.
- Nor some secret strategy.

It was putting in the reps every single day.
Focusing on getting 1% better every time.

And most importantly, not allowing myself to give up.
Even when each new post made it seem it was never going to work.

Since then, I kept on going.

- 40,000+ followers on my profile. 
- 120,000+ followers for my team.  
- 1500+ meetings booked.
- 120+ B2B clients signed.

Its about building a scalable, automated, always-on GTM machine.

Ive spent 150+ hours testing, mapping, and deploying AI Agents across our stack.

’ Operator (ChatGPT)
’ Airtop

Writes cold emails, handles replies, and books meetings.

’ Artisan
’ Jason AI
’ AISDR
’ Topo
’ 11x

3. The Ops Brain (AI-powered)

Builds and maintains the systems behind the outbound engine.

’ Relevance AI
’ Wordware
’ Relay.app
’ Taskade
’ n8n
’ Dify

4. The GTM Copilot (AI-powered)

Orchestrates multi-channel workflows and helps scale complex GTM motion.

’ Common Room
’ Bardeen
’ Jasper
’ Copy.ai
’ Unify

5. The Closers Assistant (AI-powered)

Summarizes calls, flags objections, and supports deals-in-flight.

’ Attention
’ Attio

These tools dont replace humans entirely.

They amplify them.

GTM leaders in 2025 will win by designing workflows where Agents do the grunt work.

Heres a breakdown we made with Soheil Saeidmehr (Head of Strategy at ColdIQ):

1. Whats your primary objective?

’ Cold Email: Great for booking meetings or promoting lead magnets directly.

’ LinkedIn DMs: Better for nurturing warm leads or starting strategic conversations within your ecosystem.


2. How much outreach volume do you need?

’ Cold Email: Scales more easily. Expect ~50 emails/day per mailbox. Add more inboxes to increase output.

’ LinkedIn DMs: Tighter limitstypically 100 DMs/week per profile. Harder to scale with a small team.


3. Do you have the infrastructure to win?

’ Cold Email: Youll need a deliverability system dialed in (warmup, DNS, rotations).

’ LinkedIn: An optimized profile is essential. Your page does the selling.


4. Do you have the right tools?

’ Cold Email Tools:

Sending: Instantly, Woodpecker, Smartlead, lemlist.
Data: Prospeo, Icypeas, LeadMagic, FullEnrich.
Deliverability: Instantly, ColdIQ.

’ LinkedIn Tools:

Sending: HeyReach, lemlist (multi-channel).
Engagement: Breakcold (manual), Trigify (signal-based)


5. Who are you targeting?

’ Cold Email: Works broadly across industries. If your buyer checks their inbox, its fair game.

’ LinkedIn: Strongest with Tech buyers, marketers, founders (anyone active on the platform).


6. Whats your reply-rate tolerance?

’ Cold Email: Lower reply rates, but scalable.

’ LinkedIn: Higher reply rates, but tough to ramp volume quickly without more hands.


7. Whats the biggest challenge youre ready to solve?

’ Cold Email: Deliverability is the battlefield. Beating SPAM filters and crowded inboxes is key.

’ LinkedIn: Platform limits are your bottleneck = connections, DMs, and attention span.


Which one are you picking?

I've tested 30+ tools over the past years.

These 10 still make the cut, and theyve helped me book 1,200+ inbound meetings that led to growing my company to $4,500,000+ per year “


1. Ideation and Inspiration

’ Taplio

Still one of the best for surfacing viral posts in your niche.

I use it to reverse-engineer high-performing content: format, topic, structure, timing.

’ Kleo

Great for analysing posts from specific creators.

Just visit their profile, and Kleo ranks their content by likes, comments, reposts, or recency. Perfect for finding patterns.

’ Claude AI (Anthropic)

Helps me understand what made certain posts take off.

Also great for generating hooks, repurposing content, or brainstorming new angles.


2. Writing and Editing

’ Grammarly

Simple but powerful. As a non-native English speaker, it catches the errors I miss.

Helps polish content quickly, especially under tight publishing schedules.

’ Notion

My central content hub. I jot down ideas, draft posts, and map out the publishing calendar here.

It's where raw thoughts become finished content.


3. Visual Creation

’ Canva

Perfect for beginner-friendly carousels and visuals.

I used this early on and still recommend it to anyone starting out.

’ Figma

While I dont use it personally, my team does.

Most of the ColdIQ visuals that drove big reach came from Clara designing in Figma & Ada Beltrán (using Adobe)

’ Ezgif

Turns short videos into GIFs.

Ive found that posting a sped-up 10-second GIF gets more engagement than the same clip as a videoespecially when its muted.


4. Video Content

’ OpusClip

AI video clipping tool I use to turn long-form content into short LinkedIn-native videos.

Not perfect, but some 2-minute edits have pulled 40,000+ views.

’ Screen Studio

Mac-only screen recorder that automates zooms and clean transitions.

It makes tutorial-style videos look professional without much effort.


5. Scheduling and Publishing

’ Taplio (again)

Beyond ideation, it covers scheduling, performance tracking, and post planning.

If you only use one tool, make it this.

’ Notion (again)

Used as my day-to-day planner to keep ideas organized and publication consistent.


Thats my 2025 LinkedIn stack.

I tested hundreds. Here's what you need:


1/ A great B2B data sourcing platform

Proper data is the foundation of all successful outbound campaigns.

You can use standard databases...
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- Ocean.io

Niche databases...
- Openmart for local businesses.

Alternatively, you can scrape custom data, leverage intent data (e.g: Common Room or Unify) or use AI Agents (e.g: Relevance AI or Linkup) to scour the web for you.


2/ Accurate data enrichment

You'll need valid emails or phone numbers to reach out to your prospects. 

For this, point solutions such as Prospeo.io, Icypeas & LeadMagic work very well.

For waterfall enrichment, you can use FullEnrich.


3/ Sales engagement platforms that deliver your message

Deliverability is a challenge for most.

Pick a platform that has 'deliverability' in mind.

Some examples to send emails include:
- Instantly.ai
- Woodpecker.co 

When it comes to LinkedIn outreach, you can use:
- HeyReach.io
- Valley

And if you want to combine emails, phone + calling within a single platform... You should use lemlist.


4/ Platforms to track & close your pipeline

As soon as you start generating lots of pipeline, you'll want a CRM to keep track of your deals, and a note-taker to keep track of your conversations.

We use Attio & Attention respectively.

urn:li:ugcPost:7325829912865529856,"I started running outbound campaigns 6 years ago. Then, grew a cold email agency from 0 to $4,500,000+ ARR in the last 2. Here are 7 things I wish I knew when I started:

1/ Spend most of your time on the list

Putting your message in front of the right person matters more than anything else.

Thus&

’ Clearly define your ICP
’ Precisely figure out what problem youre solving.
’ Find companies struggling with the problem you can solve.


2/ Provide as much value as you can

Focus on giving instead of getting.

This means&

’ Think of the first thing youd do if you signed your prospect.
’ Do it already.
’ Provide it for free.


3/ Write for 1 person

Find 1 ideal prospect and write as though they were the only person on your list.

Then&

’ Find 19 others, and repeat the process.
’ Identify patterns among these 20 people.
’ Only then, scale/automate your sending to more people.


4/ Fix your deliverability

Bad deliverability guarantees your campaigns will fail.

Make sure you&

’ Send few emails (< 50/day) from secondary mailboxes.
’ Set up your DMARC, SPF & DKIM records.
’ Warm-up your mailboxes. Dont track opens.


5/ Go the EXTRA mile

Campaigns that CRUSH arent just good. Theyre great.

This requires extra effort such as&

’ Dont stop your targeting at job titles & company size. Look at events, triggers, signals, website, org. charts.
’ Dont stop at open jobs signals; scan the job descriptions.
’ Dont write just 1-2 email variations, write 5+.


6/ Pair cold emails with other channels

Cold Email is often the best B2B acquisition channel to start with. But it works better with other channels.

For example, you can&

’ Use cold emails to distribute valuable content pieces/lead magnets.
’ Make content, and reach out to people who engage.
’ Run ads to the same people you contact.


7/ Leverage AI & Technology

A fool with a tool is still a fool. But the right technology can make you 10X more efficient.

You could&

’ Figure out how to automate repetitive processes with AI & Tools.
’ Look into ColdIQs directory of Sales Prospecting Technologies.
’ Study how these platforms run their own go-to-market.

urn:li:ugcPost:7325105209544695808,"How I'd get back from 0 to $4,000,000+ per year

If I had to start over on a low budget:


1/ I'd start posting on a social platform to promote my brand name

If you're just starting, you probably have:
- lots of time
- little budget

Thus, your acquisition channel of choice should reflect that.
= time-consuming, but free to advertise.

This is the case for most organic platforms, whether it's:
- TikTok
- LinkedIn
- YouTube
- Instagram

I started with LinkedIn.

I believe it's the best to start with for B2B.
(Especially if you don't want to record videos)

Tools that help: 
³ Kleo / Taplio (find proven post ideas).
³ Canva / Figma (create visuals for your posts)


2/ I'd direct this social traffic to a landing page

Redirect traffic to a simple, but clear landing page, that describes what you sell, to whom, and how it helps.

The most efficient way I found to do so has been to record a short (5 to 8 minutes) video sales letter in which I break down my offering.

This massively improves conversion rates.

For people who don't buy or book meetings straight away, you can:
- use tools that de-anonymise your visitors (to re-engage them later)
- create a helpful guide or lead magnet (to grab their email addresses)

Tools that help:
³ Instantly.ai / Vector ={ (identify website visitors)


3/ I'd reach out to every person who has shown some interest

Every qualified person who showed interest should receive a message from you.

Here, before deploying any automation trick, I'd manually send the first 30 to 50 outreach messages.

This will force you to rework & improve your message constantly while you uncover patterns within your prospects.

These patterns can be leveraged later down the line, when you start scaling or automating your outreach.

Here's an easy, non-pushy template you can use:

""Hey {name}, seems my latest post around {topic} resonated. It probably came at the right time considering you're currently {initiative}?

Happy to exchange ideas on {making initiative succesful} anytime""

When you're ready to scale your sending, there are plenty of tools you can use, such as:

- Prospeo.io / Icypeas / LeadMagic / FullEnrich (to find emails)
- Instantly.ai / Woodpecker.co / Smartlead (to send emails)
- lemlist (to reach out across phone, email & LinkedIn)
- HeyReach.io (to send LinkedIn DMs)


4/ I'd repeat steps 1 to 3 until I inevitably find clients

- Content generates traffic & interest
- Prospects book a meeting or show interest
- Talk to the ones who booked a call, message the others.

And then...

Use the objections and pain points you heard in these meetings to guide your content creation:

- create more & better content
- talk to more prospects

Repeat this cycle.
Over & over.

Long enough.
Until you inevitably improve.

Stay patient. Be consistent.
I promise, this works.

Good luck!

urn:li:activity:7323655072477810688,"The sales stack that runs our $4.4M+ agency:


CONTEXT

We run outbound campaigns for > 70 B2B organisations.

We need to be flexible because our clients are:
- in different niches
- targeting various personas
- at different stages (enterprise, scaleups, SMBs)

Some platforms overlap, since we adapt to clients' existing software stack.


TOOLS

1/ Data

""The list is the strategy""

The first step in a successful outbound campaign is to build an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) list.

We can do this in several ways:
- exporting data from b2b databases
- scraping websites to find custom data
- leveraging ai agents to research data at scale
- uncovering buying intent by using monitoring signals

Depending on the use case, we'll leverage:

- AI Agents: Relevance AI, Claygent
- Enrichment Platforms: Prospeo.io, FullEnrich, Icypeas, LeadMagic
- Intent Data: Common Room, Trigify.io, LoneScale, Unify, Vector ={
- Data Scrapers: Instant Data Scraper, PhantomBuster, ZenRows, Serper

- Data Sources: 
Openmart (local data)
DiscoLike (ai lookalikes)
TheirStack (technology data)
LinkedIn, Apollo, Ocean (b2b databases)

To validate this data, we use 1 out of Instantly.ai, BounceBan, LeadMagic or NeverBounce.


2/ Outreach

""The right message, in front of the right person, at the right time""

The right message is easier to write when you have the right person.

That said, you can get some extra help with platforms like Octave for ICP research, Twain for copywriting or Grammarly for spelling.

To send these ""right"" messages, we use Instantly.ai (best at email outreach) & lemlist (best at multichannel outreach)

Depending on projects, other platforms we'll use include:
- Woodpecker.co, Unify, Smartlead (for email sending).
- HeyReach.io (for LinkedIn outreach)
- Salesfinity (for cold calling)


3/ Workflow Orchestration

To bridge the gap between outreach & data, we use workflow builders that let us add conditions around how data should interact with sales engagement platforms.

In practice, that means that platforms like Relevance AI, Default, Clay or n8n allow you to automate:

- receiving enriched contact data
- creating conditions for whether someone shall be contacted
- routing leads to the appropriate campaign
- reaching out

The best way to think about 'workflow orchestration' is to imagine what you'd do manually if you had all the time in the world. Then, replicate these manual steps using workflow builders.


4/ Deal Closing

We use OutboundSync to synchronise leads generated through outbound efforts with our clients' CRM.

Plus, we use:
- Attio as our CRM.
- Breakcold for social selling.
- Attention for meeting recording.
- Qwilr to send proposals after our prospects' meetings.

That's it.

Once again... we use way more tools than necessary because we switch from one to another depending on our clients.

If you're running outbound for your company...
Pick 1 platform max per category.

And you'll do just fine.

(and book 1,200+ meetings in the process)

Here's how I'm using them =G

1/ Taplio

Taplio has a suite of features to help you grow on LinkedIn, including stats, analytics, AI content generator, content calendar & scheduler & more.

Most importantly... they have an in-app feed that let you visualise viral content in your niche.

You can scroll through it, find posts that perform well& and then reverse-engineer them to reproduce their performance.


2/ Kleo

Kleo is my favourite free extension to find viral posts from specific creators.

Browse the LinkedIn profile of your favourite content creator... and Kleo will sort their posts by:

- number of likes
- or comments
- or reposts
- or by recency

Same idea as with Taplio, but applied to a specific person instead of a niche.


3/ Grammarly

English isnt my native language, so I make many grammatical mistakes in my writing.

These get corrected in real-time, thanks to Grammarlys extension. 

(Including the sentence you just read right above!)


4/ OpusClip

Opus repurposes long-form video into short-form videos with AI.

The output isnt as good as when a professional editor does it.

But its very effective. And I had plenty of these short-form videos reach 40,000+ impressions (they only took me 5 minutes to do)

urn:li:activity:7320393773543272448,"The SDR role is changing because of AI.

What used to take hours, now takes minutes.

But does that mean they are any less valuable?

I dont believe so. 
But I believe GTM teams need to adapt to this shift.

The Old Way:

A) An SDR is given a list of accounts.
B) They reach out across email, LinkedIn and the phone.

The New Way:

A) Specialists own a channel. 
B) Systems sync prospecting across channels.


What does that mean for the SDR?

In my opinion, one of 2 things:

1/ You double down on human skills.

AI isnt coming for people who are great at cold calling anytime soon.

But also, it means more time spent on:
- Working complex deals
- Account planning strategy
- Building relationships & multithreading

2/ You lean into the technical side of outbound

Learn how to use AI and technologies such as Relevance AI, Clay, Instantly.ai, lemlist, Common Room & others to build GTM Systems.


The best SDR teams have both:

’ GTM Engineers build systems, create large scale prospecting campaigns and feed laser-accurate data to SDRs.

’ SDRs book meetings through manual outreach and phone prospecting.

Thats what we do for ourselves.
Thats what our clients who get the best results do.
Thats what Dan currently implements for $1B+ organizations.


Are you seeing the same shift?",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7320393773543272448,,1 month ago,michel-lieben,ACoAABz69VcBRJaBY9RjHepUO_eOzgx7ou7WMl8,Michel,Lieben,Founder / CEO @ ColdIQ | Scale Outbound with AI & Tech =I coldiq.com,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQGTSYwr7t9lGQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1711976708629?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=wYLrjp8wXzgE4Exk6p7UMhoo9tbW2kdWYSddyHkKvX0,2.0,,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes
urn:li:activity:7320031280744603648,"How it started: 4,000 cold emails sent. 1 lead generated.

How its going: $4M+ ARR. Top 1% Agency Award. 30-person team. 

6 lessons that turned my outreach campaigns from crickets to conversions:


1/ The list is the strategy

Putting your message in front of the right person matters more than anything else. Many spend little time building their lead list, and a lot of time figuring out what to say. Do the opposite. 

Hint: You want to identify people/companies struggling with a problem you can solve.

For example, we ran campaigns for an HR SaaS that helped with employee churn. We looked at Glassdoor reviews, and the average employee tenure.

If employees stayed less than 18 months on average, + reviews were bad& we hypothesized the companies were a fit.


2/ Be as valuable as possible

Most cold outreach try to get.

can I have 15 min of your time?
can I pick your brain on& ?

But the best outreach gives.

How to do that? Think about the first thing you would do for them if you signed them as clients. 

And do it already& for free.

For example, I ran an outreach campaign targeting recruitment firms.

I figured that the first thing Id do for them, would be to build a list of Talent Acquisition Directors in companies hiring for 10+ roles.

So I built the list. Sent it to them. Along with a tutorial of how I built it.

It worked.


3/ Write for 1 person, then scale.

Most try to build the biggest list possible and come up with a message thatll appeal to everyone.

But appealing to everyone = appealing to no one.

When I start a new outreach campaign, I manually write 25 messages, 1 by 1, by looking at my prospect LinkedIn profiles.

The beauty of doing it this way, is that you uncover patterns, that you can later on scale with the help of tech & AI.


4/ Fix your deliverability

Good deliverability doesnt guarantee youll succeed.

But bad deliverability guarantees youll fail.

Make sure to follow best practices

- < 50 emails per day per mailbox
- SPF, DKIM, DMARC Setup
- No open rate tracking
- Secondary domains
- Email warm-up

& and send emails youd want to receive.


5/ Pair cold email with other channels

Cold email is a great channel to start with. Its cheaper than paid ads, faster to get results than with content. 

But when you send cold emails, people check you out.

Guess wholl they trust more between your competitor whos a ghost online vs. you whos been posting valuable content on a consistent basis?


6/ Use the best Sales Software

The outbound landscape keeps on changing. The best tools stay on top of the market, and ship new features constantly.

In the cold email world, no one ships faster than Instantly.ai& (and Im not saying that because they gave me this beautiful golden plaque, theyre simply the best)


P.S: We wrote a 14-page guide that includes how our $4M ARR outbound agency books meetings using AI & Tech. Interested? Let me know below and Ill make sure you get it :)

urn:li:activity:7318593722487607297,"I want all my employees to reach 10,000 followers on LinkedIn.

Heres why, and how Im making it happen =G 

As it stands, we have 7 people at 10,000+ followers:

- Michel: 37,007 followers
- Alex: 35,442 followers
- Dan: 17,374 followers
- Fivos: 15,122 followers
- Ivan: 11,602 followers
- Gerardo: 10,425 followers
- Soheil: 9,801 followers =@ 
 
(Homage Monika who got banned at 9,000+ followers, and got back up to 6,400 already)

The reason why I want these numbers to grow further?

LinkedIn booked us 1,000+ meetings in 2024. These were responsible for adding > $2.2M in ARR. 

Having multiple people publish exposes prospects to so many pieces of content& that by the time they jump on a call with us, theyre already half sold.

I believe we can do more. So were doubling down

Heres what works best for us in 2025:

1/ Using platforms like Taplio, Kleo or Scripe for post ideation 

Theyll help you find post that went viral or simply performed well. 

This, IMO, is the fastest way to understand what good posts look like.

Gain inspiration from the hooks, frameworks, formatting, CTAs.

Re-use the structure of winning posts and apply them to your niche


2/ Engaging with others on the platform

It takes time, but it looks like LinkedIn gives you way more reach when youre actively commenting on others posts.

I read an experiment last year where someone tried:

- only comments for a week
- only posts for a week 
- posts + comments

They had the most profile views when they did both posting & commenting.

But interestingly, commenting alone drove more views than posting alone.

Try replying to every comment you get in the first 30 minutes. And that half an hour before posting to engage with other creators.


3/ Visuals

A great visual, on a text-only post, can go as far as 5Xing the reach of your posts.

Schemas, carousels, and infographics perform great for us.

Id recommend hiring a great designer and having them create designs for your whole team.

Look at people like Pierre Herubel or Nick Broekema for inspiration around great visuals.


4/ Repurposing 

Dont hesitate to repurpose your best pieces 1-2 months later.

If you study the biggest creators on the app, and look at their most viral posts& youll notice theyve published these several times and got as many likes every time.

Most viewers forget your posts. New followers havent seen them yet.

Take your best post, publish it again. Itll likely perform just as well.

You can also change formats. 

An infographic can become a carousel or a video. 
This changes the post, even though you convey the same message.

Whos making LinkedIn posting a priority for 2025? =K

urn:li:ugcPost:7318219272252493824,"ColdIQ just crossed $4,000,000 ARR.

It took us 27 months, and heres how we got there:

1ã [0 to $7,800/mo] Cold Outreach

I found our first clients via cold email using Instantly.ai.

I tried selling ""Sales automation services"" by targeting Founders & CEOs at companies between 3 and 15 people that were 'currently hiring salespeople'.

The campaign was an epic fail. No one understood my pitch. But by luck, some still wanted to hear more.

I ended up closing 2 deals... one of them at 1 AM from my hotel room in Bali (it was 11 AM in Chicago).

Takeaway: Everything doesn't need to be perfect; you get lucky sometimes... but you need to take action to get lucky.


2ã [$7,800 to $40,000/mo] LinkedIn Content + Outbound

I started posting consistently on LinkedIn around March 2023.

I wasn't getting any results in the beginning... but content was positively impacting the results of our cold outreach campaigns.

(I assume people would check us out once they'd got an email from us. And seeing our content would prove to them that we knew what we were talking about).

After posting 30+ times without results. I ended up being lucky with a post that got 146K+ views, booked 30 meetings, and allowed me to close 3 clients.

Takeaways: 
1/ In the beginning, you should see content as a trust mechanism, before expecting it to generate inbound. 

2/ You need to be consistent to get 'lucky'.


3ã [$40,000 to $90,000/mo] Scaling LinkedIn Content with Employees

LinkedIn became a consistent channel for booking qualified meetings, so we doubled down.

In March 2024, we had 6 people consistently posting in the team (Alex, Monika, Dan, Fivos, Hugues & I)

Some of my friends told me they had to mute my content & ColdIQ's because they were seeing us everywhere.

(I'm still pissed about it, but also, it does show how effective it's been).

Takeaway: If something works, do more of it.


4ã [$90,000/mo to $370,000/mo] New offers, New channels, More content

We launched more offers:
1/ A coaching program in which we teach what we do.
2/ An email infrastructure service for companies that want to run their own outbound, but don't want to make their life harder figuring out deliverability.
3/ LinkedIn Ads services led by Ivan Falco.

We added more acquisition channels:
1/ Allbound (mixed inbound & outbound together)
2/ LinkedIn Ads (starting by boosting our best-performing posts through thought leader ads).
3/ SEO (through ramping up blog articles and creating directories)

Not everything worked as well. And I believe we could've grown faster if we had 'focused' more.

Takeaway: Don't chase shiny objects. The fastest way to grow is to double down on your best performing offering.

I recorded a 25-minute breakdown in which I share the entire story...

with details around my biggest learnings, what I'd change if I could start again, as well as my plan for 2025.

Together, these products generate > $30M/year... and I always wondered what technologies were used at this revenue level.

I asked Charles Tenot (CEO at lempire) and, crazy enough, he gave it all away =G


1ã Content

lemlist was one of the first teams to dominate LinkedIn marketing.

They use:
- Taplio, which they now own, for content ideation, planning & analytics.
- Figma for designs/infographics.

For SEO, they use:
- Ahrefs & Semrush (keyword research + ranking monitoring)
- Google Search Console (to monitor website organic performance)


2ã Prospecting

They use their multi-channel sales engagement platform: lemlist. 

For data sourcing, they use:

- B2B databases: lemlist, People Data Labs & Apollo.
- Fundraising data: Crunchbase
- Technology data: BuiltWith.

For intent data, they use:

- LoneScale (monitors job postings, new hires & job changes)
- Snitcher / Revenue Institute (website visitor identification)
- G2 

For advanced data use-cases, they use Clay (e.g, for sourcing niche data & leveraging its AI Agent).

For deliverability, they use their platform, lemwarm, one of the very 1st email warmup platforms.

Finally, they leverage large AI models such as OpenAI, Anthropic's Claude, Mistral AI...)


3ã Product

They use several platforms for production data, including:

- BigQuery (= data warehouse)
- Google Cloud Platform (= to deploy applications in the cloud)
- Holistics Data ( = business intelligence platform for analytics)
- dbt Labs & RudderStack (= customer data platform for data transformation)

For prototyping, their stack includes:

- Replit (to develop + deploy software)
- Vercel V0 (code generation & user interface)


4ã Marketing Funnel

Their stack includes Mixpanel + Google Analytics to track product/website metrics.

They use Hightouch as a 'reverse ETL platform', which extracts + transforms + loads centralized data into all their other apps (so that every department works on synchronized data).

On top of these, they use:
- Email marketing: Customer.io
- Lead routing: Default
- Website = Webflow
- CMS = WordPress


5ã Sales

Their sales stack includes:

- CRM: HubSpot
- Meeting recording: Spoke
- Meeting scheduling: lemcal
- Sales compensation: Qobra


6ã Finance

Finance apps:

- Payment processing: Stripe
- Business bank account: Qonto
- All-in-one accounting solution: Pennylane
- Subscription analytics: ProfitWell by Paddle


7ã Customer support & Team comms

- Team communications: Slack
- Customer support: Intercom
- Team collaboration: Notion
- Advanced automation: n8n

And that's it.

Pretty sure some apps are missing, given the #.

(Pick 1-2 tools per category)

1/ Start with data sourcing platforms

My favourites include:
- Clay (AI agents, Intent Data & 100+ enrichment platforms in one place)
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (the originator of most B2B databases)
- Ocean.io (Niche segments & lookalike audiences)


2/ Next step: enrichment with phone & email finding platforms:

My favourite point solutions include:
- Prospeo.io, LeadMagic & Icypeas

My favourite waterfalls solution is FullEnrich.

Pro Tip: The above enrichment platforms can be used inside Clay with their API.


3/ For additional context to my outreach, I like monitoring companies' buying signals

My favourite solutions in that regard include:
- Unify (Aggregates signals, AI agents & workflow orchestration in one place)
- Common Room (By far the platform that monitors the most intent signals)
- Trigify.io (The king of social intent)


4/ Once you've built your lead lists, you'll want to reach out to your leads... while making sure your messages deliver

I recommend:
- HeyReach.io (Best LinkedIn outreach solution to scale sending)
- Instantly.ai (Most comprehensive & innovative email sending solution)
- lemlist (Best all-in-one platform to engage leads across several channels)

Alternatives include: Woodpecker.co (all-in-one emailing) & Expandi.io (Linkedin)


5/ Finally, you could use some tech to help you get deals across the finish line

Some we use:

- Breakcold for manual social selling.
- Qwilr to help us craft sales proposals.
- Default for automated inbound lead routing.

(It's easier to fix than you think)

’ Improving your email deliverability.


Here's a 7-step guide to do so:

1/ Build a robust email infrastructure

 = Purchase secondary domains/mailboxes.

You can use ColdIQ premium email infrastructure or Instantly.ai done-for-you email set up.


2/ Warmup your domain and gradually increase your daily sends.

lemlist, Instantly.ai, Woodpecker.co, Smartlead, MailReach all include warm-up features that'll help improve your email reputation.


3/ Clead your lead lists

If your emails bounce a lot, you're sending a bad signal to email platforms. Wich improve your odds of landing in spam.

Make sure you use reputable tools to find + validate emails (for example LeadMagic, FullEnrich, Prospeo.io, Icypeas)


4/ Optimize your copy

Try to use:
- spintax
- plain text
- few links


... and remove open rate tracking.


5/ Match your email service provider with your prospect's

Instantly.ai has a feature that automatically sends emails to Google mailboxes using other Google mailboxes... and likewise for Outlook to Outlook.


6/ Most importantly... send emails you'd want to receive.

 
Youre sending unsolicited emails. 

Prospects are receiving too many already.

If you provide great value, you can break all the rules as much as you want... and you should still be alright!

Here are the features you should master first:

1/ AI-Powered Formulas

Why?

³ Clay lets you use AI to create some conditional formulas that will help you build precise & complex tables. Knowing how to use this feature will allow you to put any growth idea you have into existence.

My ranking: S-Tier


2/ Clays AI Agent (Claygent)

Why?

³ Claygent acts like an army of assistant that scours the web to surface any data point you need. Finding the right data is the most essential element to successful outbound campaigns. And none do it better than Clays AI Agent.

My ranking: S-Tier


3/ HTTP API Integrations

Why?

³ Clay has 100+ native integrations with data platforms. This means you can do most of your data enrichment natively with Clay. But sometimes, Clay doesnt integrate with the platform you need. Being able to manually connect it yourself means you're not limited to existing integrations.

My ranking: A-Tier


4/ Waterfall Enrichment

Why?

³ You can aggregate best-in-class phone & email finders to enrich data. 1 good solution = finding ~50% of your list. 5+ good solutions = up to 85% finding rate.

My ranking: A-Tier


5/ Using AI Models in Spreadsheets

Why?

³ You can leverage Claude, OpenAI & other models on many records at one. This entails prompting actions such as GPT lead scoring, AI messaging personalization, 10-K Reports analyses and more.

My ranking: S-Tier

Here's how to upgrade your tech stack with AI:

1ã Use AI apps for building leads lists

Your ability to put the message in front of the right person is the biggest predictor of your outreach campaign's success.

Some AI applications make the process easier by helping you:
- Build lead lists
- Deeply research prospects
- Segment & score prospect

Examples include:
- Relevance AI Prospect Researcher and Enrichment agents
- Clays AI Agent and Integration with 100+ data platforms.
- Exas AI Research & Data Sourcing Agent


2ã Use AI to orchestrate complex workflows

Running cold email campaigns used to be fragmented across several platforms and involved moving around .csv files from one tool to another.

Workflow builders & AI agents now help you:
- Build a list 
- Score your leads
- Find their Emails
- Verify these Emails
- Personalise your messaging with AI
- And import to leads to a sales engagement platform

& all that from a single tool.

Examples for these tools include Clay, Relevance AI, Common Room & Unify.


3ã Use AI to improve your deliverability

A message that doesnt get read, doesnt get replied to. Every year, deliverability is getting harder to crack.

Thankfully, a few sending platforms are leveraging AI to help with:
- Secondary domains & mailboxes setup
- Automated Spintaxxing
- Email warm-ups

Examples include: Instantly.ai, lemlist & Woodpecker.co.


4ã Use AI to help close your deals

Were still far from seeing AI successfully replacing humans in Google Meet.

But the AI bots are already listening to these sales conversations.

They already help by:
- Taking notes from convos
- Surfacing insights from individual conversations
- Surfacing aggregate insights from MANY conversations

For example, one thing I like to do is ask Attention what our prospects have asked most in our latest 100+ sales conversations.

Once I know that, I can address these points in our messaging.

- LinkedIn Content: Educate prospects that become 'warm'

2. Key Rules to win:

- Cold Email: Top-notch deliverability. Short messages.
- LinkedIn: Consistent, high-quality posts. In-depth writing.

 3. Software

Cold Email:

- Sending: Instantly.ai, Woodpecker.co, Smartlead, lemlist
- Finding emails: FullEnrich, Prospeo.io, Icypeas, LeadMagic
- Email Infrastructure: ColdIQ, Instantly.ai

LinkedIn:

- Ideation: Kleo, Taplio
- Writing: Grammarly, Anthropic (Claude)
- Visuals: Canva, Figma, OpusClip

4. Reach

- Cold Email: 'Fewer' eyeballs. Very targeted.
- LinkedIn: Variable eyeballs (from few to A LOT). Hard to target precisely.

5. Challenges

- Cold Email: Hard to beat spam filters & standing out in crowded inboxes.
- LinkedIn: Hard to stay consistent. Can take weeks before seeing results

urn:li:ugcPost:7312782845880520706,"I failed 7 businesses before getting one to $320,000+ per month

Here's what I didn't understand back then:

These failures were the building block for this successful venture.

Let me explain “

1/ My first business was a clothing brand called Tulipe.

We sold 15 T-shirts in total, at a discount. Which probably amounts to $300 in sales.

We had ordered 400. Thus, there are 385 T-shirts left with nothing to do with.

Producing these costs us ~$2,800 as well as some plane trips. 

On top of these, we spent time creating social profiles, running ads and made a website.

’ Result of the operation: - $3,200 loss.

BUT, I did learn how to create websites. Which is a skill I then used for all my next 'attempts', including for my current business.


2/ Another business I launched was a raffle lottery called Rafflrs

I invested $40,000 of my money. Spread between lawyers who overcharged us, app development and Facebook ads. I got back $0.

’ Result of the operation: - $40,000 loss.

BUT, I did learn how to run ads while burning all my money. We now book 15-20% of our meetings with paid ads. And offer it as a service (which generates some pretty nice results!)


3/ I also launched a Facebook Ads agency called Convrsion

To find clients, I sent some... cold emails. These were actually so successful that I realized I'd be way better off offering these as a service than selling ad campaigns.

I eventually did, and ColdIQ is now close to a $4M ARR business.


4/ I owned a sports betting affiliate website.

This one started well, as it went up to $6,000 per month in revenue. 

Unfortunately (for me), regulation changes in Belgium meant that bookmakers could no longer offer welcome bonuses... which my site was all about.

But I did learn a lot about affiliate marketing. And we generate > 5-Figure in passive commissions every month.


5/ I started a couple of 'niche' blogs 

None of them made a single $1. But I learned SEO & Copywriting.

These skills helped us drive 83,000 visitors to our website in the last 90 days... and gather 12,000,000+ impressions to my LinkedIn posts in the previous couple of years.


The takeaway? You win or you learn.

I don't know anyone who made it big on their first attempt. 

(I'm sure they exist)

But the truth is, each failure teaches you a lesson that allows you to try again... better.

Finding contacts' emails = 1,200 emails.

Verifying emails = 900 valid emails.

³ 2,000 contacts - 900 valid emails = 1,100 wasted opportunities.


Here's how to bring this 'wasted' number to (close to) 0:

1/ Switch to better email finders

We find 100,000+ valid email addresses every month using platforms such as Prospeo.io, LeadMagic, & Icypeas.

There are plenty of good tools in the 'email finder' category, but these are among the best.


2/ Leverage waterfall enrichment

Waterfall platforms like FullEnrich aggregate 15+ solutions to find email addresses (& phone numbers).

If one solution can't find a valid email, there are good odds another one can.

This can improve email finding rate from 50 to 85%.

Note that other platforms, such as Clay & lemlist, also have built-in waterfall within their tool.


3/ Validate catch-all emails

³ = emails that cannot 'normally' be validated.

You usually get valid, invalid, or catch-all emails.

Invalid means don't send an email at all.
Valid means safe.

Catch-all means you'll need to find another way to verify the validity of emails.

An increasing number of email finders are adding catch-all verification features.

We like to use Instantly.ai / BounceBan for this use case.

urn:li:ugcPost:7310608398054535168,"How to beat 99% of your competition:

(If you're a lead generation agency)

ColdIQ has grown from 0 to $3.6M+ in ARR in the last 2 years.

If I had to start again... I'd make sure to do these 5 things “


1/ Pick a 'niche' within my service offering, and dominate it.

There are 1000s of other lead generation & outbound agencies.

Instead of claiming you're the best... 

You'd be better off positioning yourself as the most knowledgeable around deliverability, or copywriting, or data sourcing, or ai prompting or outbound tools... (whichever you like best)

Prospects have a bias for what they believe is most important.

If they have the same bias as you, they'll pick you first.

And the beauty of agencies is that only need a few clients to make a decent revenue.


2/ Invest in my brand from day 1

The difference between charging a $1,200/mo retainer vs. getting upfront ~$50k payments?

³ Having gathered enough social proof / trust.

This means you want to share case studies, client testimonials. You want to stay in a niche for long enough.

But imo, the fastest way to gather trust is to educate your ICP with great content... that demonstrates you know what you're talking about.


3/ Saying no to 'bad fit' clients

It can be difficult to say 'no' to more money. But bad clients end up costing you much more in the long run.

They'll...
- take more time
- consume more of your resources
- while being more likely to be unhappy with your service

Saying no to bad clients = having more time to spend on good clients.

You lose out on cash in the short term. But it'll help you massively in the long run.


4/ Hiring the best at all costs

Lots of agencies try to spend as little as possible on their team.

It makes sense if you run the numbers, since less overhead costs = higher margins.

But I found that better talents, means clients end up more satisfied, meaning they stay longer... which actually helps margin in the long run.

Pay people well. It costs more, but clients stay longer. Which ends up making you more profitable.


5/ Join forces with the smartest people you know

Alex Hormozi wrote a post that reads:

""Gates owns 1% of Microsoft. Bezos owns 9% of Amazon. Musk owns 17% of Tesla. Buffet owns 18.7% of Berkshire Hathaway.

These incredibly successful people understand one main thing. 

The more money you make for other people, the more money you make yourself. Even though the pie is not 100% yours.""

I grew ColdIQ on my own to $15,000+ per month.

But since I partnered with Alex, the business grew > 20x since... and much quicker that it'd have if I stayed on my own. 

We also were lucky to have people like Dan & Fivos who joined in the early days. They had such a massive impact that it was a no-brainer to make them Partners at ColdIQ.

Find great people. Share a piece of the cake with them. They'll make it a much bigger one.

Me: How much do you have?

Scrolling LinkedIn can make you feel like youre missing out on all the greatest tech.

And while there are lots of good tools.

You can get away with a great stack for under $250/mo.

Here are my recommendations: 

(Whether you have $250, $500, $1,500 or $5,000+ to spend per month)


1ã 0 to $250/mo

At this spend, you'll be better off with a platform that can do it all.

You want tools that take care of lead sourcing + sales engagement.

My favourites are:
- lemlist (from $69/mo)
- Instantly.ai (from $37/mo)

(Woodpecker.co & Smartlead are solid options, too)

Total = $37 to $99 per month.


2ã $250 to $500/mo

At this spending level, it's worth investing in a 'strong' data platform that you can combine with Instantly or lemlist.

I recommend Clay, which will provide:
- score your leads using ai models
- research & scrape the web with their ai agent
- access 100+ platforms with just one subscription

... and a lot more (I have a video on that, lmk if you want to see it!)

I recommend going for Clay's $314/mo, which will grant you access to their API.

Total = $186 to $448 per month.


3ã $500 to $1,500/mo

If you want to scale your outbound efforts, you'll likely need to increase your budget to over $500/mo.

In such a case, I recommend adding:

[$99/mo] LinkedIn Sales Navigator or another B2B database.
[$100/mo] Enrichment tools: FullEnrich, Prospeo.io, Icypeas, LeadMagic.
[$800/mo] Clay's Pro Plan for 50K monthly credits.
[$0 ’ $149/mo] A Visitor ID platform like Vector ={ / Instantly.ai
[$50 ’ $250/mo] A CRM like Breakcold, folk, HubSpot or Attio.

Total = $1,140 to $1,489 per month.


4ã $1,500 to $5,000/mo

For more 'mature' companies, some great additions would include:

- a meeting recorder / note-taking app like Attention

- an intent platform (e.g: Common Room) to leverage and action buying signals at scale (from $999/mo)

urn:li:activity:7308797559366377472,"Fivos Aresti closed $2.4M in ARR for ColdIQ in under 10 months.

So I had to ask him: How did you close all these deals?

Here are his biggest takeaways:

1/ Using frameworks, not scripts

For every call he takes, he has a list of non-negotiable points he NEEDS to hit on every single time.

These are questions such as:

- What are the challenges preventing them from reaching their goals?
- What's their current process causing them to need help?
- What is his prospect looking for in terms of help?
- What are they looking for in a solution provider?
- Why now? What's the cost of inaction?
- What have they tried in the past?


2/ Being an expert at what he sells

In our case, cold outbound. 

Before transitioning to sales, Fivos ran cold outreach campaigns for our clients. 

Even as he started taking sales calls, he insisted on keeping clients to keep improving.

He now sells a service he knows, like the back of his hand.

This means he can run his sales calls like true consultations in which he suggests the best path forward to prospects&

Instead of having to rely on overused car salesmen techniques.


3/ Matching buyers urgency

He never pushes to close deals. If he feels buyers arent ready, hell wait. 

Its the opposite of the aggressive types of sellers you see on TV shows.

He suggests next steps & recommendations to buyers as a doctor would.


4/ Keep on learning

He never stops:

- Reading sales books 
- Watching education videos around sales, outbound, & ai.
- Consuming courses & getting 1-1 coaching from top sales experts.


5/ Multi-threading

He builds champions in prospects companies by manually writing down questions each participant had during their calls. 

After these calls, he sends 1-1 emails to each, where he answers all their questions.

Hell often take this opportunity to provide more value by sending a helpful resource.


6/ Technology

In true ColdIQ style, Fivos uses tech to make his life easier:

For example:
- Qwilr to craft high-converting proposals.
- HubSpot to log centralised information around deals
- Platforms like Attention & Circleback to record meetings, take notes & automatically update deals in the CRM

And added +$1M in net new ARR last month to a $30M ARR SaaS.

I'm talking about lemlist funnel. And here's the breakdown by their CEO, Charles Tenot “


1ã Lead Generation

~200,000 people visit lemlist's website every month.

To attract this traffic, they rely on:

A. LinkedIn Posts

³ The lemlist team (250k+ LinkedIn followers combined) regularly posts *free* education content around outbound, sales & growth.

B. Paid Ads

³ They run ads on Meta, Google & LinkedIn. They typically use Google for BOF intent searches. And LinkedIn to target larger companies. They spend around 20,000¬ per month.

C. SEO

³ SEO brings in ~15-20% of their signups. They create multi-lingual content - which means they rank well in several languages.

They also have a few free 'mini-tools' focusing on lead generation use cases that bring traffic to their site.

D. Affiliates

³ They work with partners & customers that spread the word about their platform. In exchange, these partners gain a percentage on deals attributed to them.

E. Webinars

³ Tal Baker-Phillips hosts a series of webinars with top voices in the sales space. (Still waiting for my invite, btw)

F. YouTube

³ They published 384 videos and grew their channel to 13,8k subscribers.

G. Guillaume Moubeche

³ Guillaume, their Founder, has a large following across social media:

- 43,200+ YouTube subscribers
- 246,000+ Instagram followers

And for the lucky ones who speak <ë<÷ he started a brand new YouTube channel in French with insane value.


2ã Lead Capture 

They convert around 7-8% of their 200,000+ month visitors.
This amounts to 14,000+ new signups per month.

To better their conversion rates, they have

-  a 14-day trial that gives access to the platform without inputting any credit card details.

- a reverse trial which switches users to their $0 plan, that still grants access to basic features.

They also allow visitors to book a demo in-app, via the website & through their onboarding email sequence.

Larger accounts get sent to dedicated landing page to push them to a demo directly.


3ã Lead Conversion

They enrich 3rd party data to enrich 'interested' accounts/prospects.

These get scored according to some thresholds:

- if these are met, they get a 1:1 demo.
- for smaller accounts, they run group demos.


In total, lemlist has 20,000+ paying users.


What should they add to hit $100M in ARR? =G

urn:li:activity:7308068473312587778,"Copy our email infrastructure setup to get > 70% open rates:

(Tried & tested on 120+ B2B companies)


1ã Create 10 to 20 new domains that forward to your main one.

E.g: scalewithcoldiq[.]com ’ coldiq[.]com

To spread your bets, purchase them through various providers (Cloudfare, Squarespace, GoDaddy or domains[.]com)

Best practice is to have 1 tenant per domain. Meaning that each domain is set up under a separate workspace, so that no inboxes are linked to each other.


2ã Set up 20 to 40 mailboxes ( = 2 per domain).

E.g:
- michel@coldiqssi[.]com
- dan@coldiqssi[.]com

The best practice is to do a 50:50 split between Google & Outlook mailboxes.

Important detail: 95% of email I receive don't have a profile picture. It's usually because it requires a manual step to set up... but it's highly recommended to add one.


3ã Warm up your domains and run your outreach with Instantly.ai.

Their platform is tailor made to help you land in the main inbox, with features such as:

- Text-only emails
- Random sending patterns
- Auto-optimize A/Z Testing (automatically picks best performing variants)
- Provider Matching (matches your leads' email provider with your mailbox provider)

Best practice is to warm up your mailboxes for ~3 weeks.


4ã Limit sending volume to 25 emails per mailbox

Gradually increase the sending volume and limit it to 25 emails per mailbox.

If you wish to scale volume, best to add new mailboxes than to send more per mailbox.

Pro tip: 25 is an arbitrary number. No one knows what's the best practice here. Feel free to scale it up or down based on your campaigns performance.


5ã Don't track opens

It's no longer reliable. And hasn't been for some time. 

It's also why you should disregard claims of high open rates, including mine. 

(FYI, it's based on an average reply rate we get, based on when we could 'more' accurately track opens. So don't completely disregard my claim, actually)

Here the best practice is to disable tracking and focus on 'better' metrics such as:
- your number of positive replies
- the number of meetings you book

After running outbound for 120+ companies:

1. Core Focus

- Cold Email: Booking direct meetings or sending lead magnets
- LinkedIn DM: Nurture existing leads or start convos with people in your ecosystem.

2. Volume / Limits

- Cold Email: 50 emails per day per mailbox.
- LinkedIn DM: 100 DMs per week.

3. Key Rules to win

- Cold Email: Solid Deliverability system
- LinkedIn: Optimized LinkedIn profile

4. Software

Cold Email: 
- Sending: Instantly.ai, Woodpecker.co, Smartlead, lemlist
- Data: Prospeo.io, LeadMagic, Icypeas, FullEnrich
- Deliverability Infrastructure: ColdIQ, Instantly.ai

LinkedIn:
- Sending: lemlist (Multi-channel), HeyReach (LinkedIn-only)
- Social Selling: Breakcold (Manual engagement), Trigify.io (Social signals)

5. Audience

- Cold Email: Anyone who checks their inboxes
- LinkedIn: People in Tech

6. Expectation

- Cold Email: Lower reply rate. Easier to scale by setting up secondary mailboxes.
- LinkedIn: Higher reply rate. Tough to scaler when few team members.

7. Challenges

- Cold Email: Hard to beat SPAM filters. Crowded inboxes.
- LinkedIn: Limited by # of connection requests & DMs.

urn:li:ugcPost:7305897918157238272,"What intent signals work best?

Heres what the data says on 100 outbound campaigns:

1ã Reaching out to your Website visitors

Why it works?

³ You're reaching out to 'warm' prospects. Based on the page they visited, you have extra information you can use to send a relevant message.

Who does it work best for?

³ Larger companies (> 50 people) with high-traffic volume (50,000+ monthly website visitors).

How to make it work?

³ Write a relevant message by combining information on 1/ The page they visited and 2/ Internal initiatives in their company (other signals).

Tools I can use?

³ Instantly.ai, Common Room, Unify, Warmly, MeetVisitors, Identity Matrix, Koala, RB2B


2ã Reaching out to past champions

Why it works?

³ They have used your product and liked it (hopefully).

Who does it work best for?

³ Companies with many existing happy users... since you can action the 'signal' once a user moves to a new company. 

How to make it work?

³ Softly re-engage your prospect. Talk about the features they seemed to enjoy most.

Tools I can use?

³ Common Room, Clay, Unify, UserGems =Ž, Champify


3ã Reaching out based on job openings

Why it works?

³ Openings suggest that budget is being unlocked for (new) initiatives within the company.

Who does it work best for?

³ For companies whose solution can help improve the output or productivity of the future new joiner.

How to make it work?

³ Scan the job description to understand priorities/responsibilities of the new joiner. Pitch your solution as a way to help the person, not replace them. 

Tools I can use?

³ Unify, PredictLeads, Clay, LoneScale, People Data Labs, Common Room


4ã Reaching out based on major events/announcements

This can be new product launches, mergers, acquisitions, funding events & other news.

Why it works?

³ Announcements precede changes. This suggests companies could try new things which they don't have experience with, which they could need help with.

When does it work best?

³ When these announcement precedes changes in areas relevant to your offering.

How to make it work?

³ Don't react to the announcement. Think of the second & third-order consequences of it. If it's a big piece of news, your prospects will be flooded with outreach messages. Think about everyone's will message them with, and say something else.

Tools I can use?

³ Clay, Crunchbase, Common Room, Unify, PitchBook, Owler - A Meltwater Offering

We have 8 people with 6,000+ followers posting daily for ColdIQ.

(Alex, Michel, Fivos, Dan, Ivan, Gerardo, Soheil, Monika)

- They share expertise & winning strategies
- They send traffic to our website
- They get inbound leads daily

This generates hundreds of sales calls for us.

Founder: ""But my A players will get many other opportunities.""

Me: ""You'd rather keep them by limiting their options rather than being the best opportunity for them?""

I welcome companies trying to poach my employees.

It forces us to consider what we provide to the people who give us their most precious asset:  their time.

But if that's not a compelling enough argument... 

Here's what you should consider:

1. Its a WIN-WIN situation

When posting on LinkedIn, your employees are getting paid to grow an asset (their personal brand). At the same time, they generate leads and revenue for your business.


2. It makes them want to STAY

Because theyre growing this lifelong asset, they have more reasons to stay in your company. So even if they get job proposals daily, they want to keep working in your business.


3. It has a compounding positive effect

All of this contributes to raising your profit margins and growing your revenue. You can reinvest this budget into more training, upskilling, or company retreats.

This is exactly what were doing.

This strategy is so powerful that we decided to reinvest.

For example by having the most followed woman on LinkedIn in the UK... train our team on the platform.

urn:li:ugcPost:7302636506395914241,"These 10 LinkedIn tools helped me gain 32,000+ followers:

(and book 1,000+ meetings in the process)


Here's how I'm using these =G

1. Taplio

Taplio has an entire suite of features to help you grow on LinkedIn:
- content creation kanban, calendar & scheduler
- ai content generator or repurposer
- stats & analytics
- ...

But most importantly... they let you visualize viral content in your niche through an in-app feed. 

This is my favourite feature as it helps gain inspiration from posts that performed well... which I can then reverse-engineer (format, topic, visual...).


2. Kleo

³ I use their extension to find viral posts from specific creators. You browse the LinkedIn profile of your favourite content creator... and Kleo will sort their posts by the one that had:

- the most likes
- or the most comments
- or the most reposts
- or by newest/oldest

Same idea as with Taplio's viral feed, but applied to a specific person instead of a niche.


3. Grammarly

³ As a non-native English speaker, I make lots of spelling mistakes in my writing. These get corrected in real-time, thanks to Grammarly's extension.


4. OpusClip

³ It's an ""AI Video Clipping Tool"" that I often use to create short-form videos out of my long-form videos. 

The output isn't as great as with a professional video editor. But it's very cost-effective and I've had a few of these videos reach 40k+ impressions here (which took me 2 min to do).


5. Screen Studio

³ It's a Mac screen recorder that I often use to record video tutorials.

It does some automated zooms & de-zooms that make the outputted videos look much fancier than they actually are.


6. Ezgif

³ It's a free website that turns videos into gifs. In my experience, you get better reach by posting a 10-second GIF than a 10-second video.

So, if you were planning to post a short audio-less video, I'd recommend that you speed it up and publish it as a GIF instead.


7. Anthropic's Claude

³ I mostly use Claude's chat interface to:

- help me analyze what made posts go viral.
- repurpose my existing posts.
- generate hooks ideas.


8. Figma

³ I don't use it myself, but Clara Güiraldes & Ada Beltrán created many great visuals for  ColdIQ using Figma.

Good visuals can 3-10X the reach of your publications. So it's worth investing in a good designer... or investing time learning how to design.


9. Canva

³ I created my first LinkedIn carousels through Canva. It is probably the most beginner-friendly app for creating visuals for social media.


10. Notion

³ I use Notion as my content planner. I note down all my post ideas. I draft my posts in it. And I have a calendar for which post should be published when.


That's it.

urn:li:activity:7302273094042173441,"Every sales tool we use to run our $3.6M+ ARR outbound agency:


CONTEXT

We run go-to-market campaigns for 60+ b2b companies.

They're:
- in various niches
- targeting different kinds of personas
- of varying sizes (startups, scale-ups, enterprise)

For this reason, we need to be flexible... 

And we use more tools than necessary for most organizations.
+ Some tools overlap as we adapt to clients' tech stack.


TOOLS

1. Data

Every campaign starts by building an ICP list.

There are several ways to do this:
- getting the data straight from b2b databases
- scraping websites to find custom data and enriching it.
- leverage buying signals to uncover intent and enrich further.
- having ai agents research information at scale and enriching it.

Depending on the project, we'll be using:

- Data Sources: LinkedIn, Apollo.io, Ocean.io
- Data Scraping: PhantomBuster, Serper, ZenRows, Instant Data Scraper
- Data Enrichment: Prospeo.io, FullEnrich, LeadMagic, Icypeas
- Intent Data: Common Room, Unify, Clay, Trigify.io, Vector ={

- AI Agents: Relevance AI, Claygent


2. Outreach

""The right message, in front of the right person, at the right time""

With proper data targeting, we've got ""the right person"" nailed down. And possibly ""the right time"" with good intent data.

Now, the right message typically stems from the right person.

The reason why someone is on your list should be compelling enough that you can tell them, and it resonates.

But you can get some help from platforms for additional research (Octave), copywriting & formatting (Twain) and grammar + spelling (Grammarly).

To then send these ""right messages"", we'll be using: 
- Instantly.ai & 
- lemlist 

for the most part. 

Other great platforms we use, depending on the projects include:
- Email sending: Woodpecker.co, Unify, Smartlead
- LinkedIn messaging: HeyReach
- Cold calling: Salesfinity


3. Workflow Orchestration

To bridge the gap between data & sending, we use workflow building platforms, which let you add logical conditions for how the data should interact with campaigns.

The whole idea is that by using platforms such as Relevance AI, Clay, n8n or Default you can automate:

- getting an in-flux of data
- creating conditions for/if someone shall be contacted
- routing leads to the most appropriate campaign
- reach out

Here you want to think about what you'd do manually if you were given enough time. Then, have these workflow platforms replicate your manual processes.


4. Deal Management

This is more for us than for clients.

We use:
- HubSpot as our CRM solution
- Breakcold for social selling
- Attention for meeting recording & sales coaching
- Qwilr to send proposals after meeting with prospects.

That's most of it.

urn:li:ugcPost:7301182983384821761,"How I'd get from 0 to $3.6M+ ARR if I had to start all over again:

(This works even if you have a low budget)


1ã Start with a free organic channel to get your brand name out there

You probably have more time than money.

Thus, you want to start with an acquisition channel that takes time but doesn't cost you much.

This could be:
- LinkedIn posts
- SEO / Blog
- YouTube
- ...

I started with LinkedIn. It's typically the 'easiest' channel to start with for B2B.

³ Helpful tools: Kleo & Taplio (to find post ideas). Canva or Figma (to create visuals that'll go with your posts).


2ã Redirect this traffic to an optimized landing page

Try clearly describing who you sell to and how you can help.

In my opinion, the most efficient way to do so is to record a 5-minute video sales letter (VSL) that breaks down your offering.

This greatly improves conversions.

But also:
- create a lead magnet to grab email addresses
- use tools to identify people visiting your website

³ Helpful tools: Instantly.ai or Vector ={ for free or cheap person-level visitor identification.


3ã Reach out to people who showcased interest

Every interested person who is a good fit for your offering should be sent a message.

Send the first 50+ messages manually before even trying to automate the process.

The reason is that sending notes manually forces you to constantly improve & rework your message while you uncover patterns within your targets. 

These patterns can later be leveraged once you decide to scale & automate your outreach.

Make sure to personalize each of these notes. So that the recipient feels it could've only been sent to them.

A short template you can use:

""Hey {name}, looks like my latest post around {topic} resonated. It probably came at the right time since you're currently doing {initiative}? 

Happy to exchange ideas on {making initiative successful} if you'd like.""

³ Tools you can use once you're ready to scale your sending: 
- Find emails: Prospeo.io / Icypeas / LeadMagic / FullEnrich
- Send emails: Instantly.ai / Woodpecker.co / Smartlead
- Send LinkedIn DMs: HeyReach
- Multichannel outreach: lemlist


4ã Repeat Steps 1 to 3 until you inevitably find your first B2B clients.

Repeat it long enough.

Patience & consistency are underrated when it comes to starting something new.

urn:li:activity:7300823623928328192,"The #1 reason your emails don't get responses?

Your prospects don't even see them.

Picture this:

- You spend $1000s on your outbound tech stack.
- Deeply research your audience and contact your ICP.
- Craft extremely personalized & relevant messages.

You're excited for your campaign to go live.
Anticipating the flood of positive replies you'll get.

A few days later?
Crickets.

You've done all the right things.
But your hard work went to waste because no one responds to emails in spam.

So what's the fix?

It's pretty simple:

³ Purchase 10 new domains.
³ Set up 2 mailboxes per domain.
³ Use AI warmup to increase reputation.
³ Only send < 30 emails per day per inbox.
³ Use platforms like Instantly to manage this.

You could do this yourself.

Or try using inbox resellers.
Or even SMTP providers.

Every option has its pros & cons.

My biased recommendation?

ColdIQ's new Email-Infra-as-a-Service:

- We handle domain purchase & setup
- We warm up your inboxes 'till they're ready to go.
- We configure all your records (SPF, DMARC, DKIM&)
- And replace any inbox that underperforms. For free.

We first created this for ourselves and our 60+ agency clients.

We're now offering it to outbound teams who want to scale their email sending.

urn:li:activity:7299733411554820096,"The secret behind growing from 0 to $3.6M+ ARR in 24 months?

Its simpler than you think:
People.

Its also my favourite part of building a business.

The relationships you build with the people you meet along the way.

Seeing your people develop as leaders and outgrow you in their respective areas.

I grew ColdIQ from 0 to $15.7k/mo on my own.

This is when Alex Vacca  joined me.
I couldnt handle marketing, sales & fulfilment all at once.

Alex had a strong operation background. Had sales knowledge. And existing exposure to AI technologies. But wasnt familiar with cold outbound yet.

He learned everything in a matter of weeks. 
And started managing our agency in a way I never could.

This freed my time to focus on whats next.

Today hes the best operational guy I know. And hes the reason why everything runs smoothly.


At around $25k/mo& Dan Rosenthal offered to work for free, so he could learn AI Cold Outreach.

Dan had a full-time job so hed work early mornings & late evenings.
I still remember us building Clay tables together at 11pm.

Soon enough, he was better than me at it.
And has since then launched 2 offers, from scratch, within ColdIQ, that generates multiple 5-figures monthly.

The true definition of an intrapreneur.

Today I trust him to lead our most ambitious projects and manage our biggest clients.


At around $35k/mo, Fivos Aresti joined the team.

We worked on his first clients together and would have calls every day.
He, too, picked up the skills in no time.

Hed deliver great work for our clients + would spend extra time listening to my sales calls& and provide some feedback on how he felt I couldve done better.

He then started taking calls in lieu of Alex and l. 
And hes responsible for closing well over $2M in ARR for our agency.

Thankfully, we also have another 20 great people.
(Which makes me think we need a new team picture)

Takeaway? Business doesnt have to be a lonely journey.

Alex Hormozi puts it best:

Elon Musk owns 20% of Tesla
Jeff Bezos owns 9% of Amazon.
Jensen Huang owns 4% of Nvidia.

Because they understand one thing:

The more money you make other people, 
The more money you make for youself.

Even if the pie isnt 100% yours.

Find great people.
Give them a piece.

AI is the new gold. The race is on.
And by the looks of it& the US will win.

And what you to do about it “

The outbound game has changed in 2024.

The trend Im seeing:

- The tech-savvy operator who matches the output of 5 SDRs by leveraging technology

³ i.e: using tools such as Clay, Relevance AI, Instantly, lemlist, Attention, Common Room

- The gifted communicator that doubles down on what AI cant do well

³ i.e: Cold Calling, in-person/visio meetings.

We've hired 25+ people for our agency.
And the difference in productivity isn't a +30% kind of differential.

Great employees outperform others by 3-5X.
And the trend is only exacerbated by AI.

If youre none of these 2 archetypes... 
Its time to assess what YOU do best before AI eats your lunch.


If you want to learn how to leverage AI in Sales& I recommend these 3 resources:
(theyll cost you less that $1)


1. Clay University [free]

= An entire free course that teaches you how to find/enrich data, research prospects & automate your outbound using AI

2. ColdIQs Mini-course [$1]

= 4-part video course on how to grow a B2B agency to 7-figure by leveraging technology & AI

3. Unifys Play Library [free]

urn:li:activity:7297193069173477376,"Heres how Id find my first 10 B2B clients if I had to start from 0:

(Its what Ive done to hit $3.6M+ ARR)


1. Find a cheap way to get my brand / name out there.

In the beginning, you have more time than money. Thus, start with an acquisition channel that takes time but costs little.

It could be:
A. LinkedIn Publications
B. YouTube Videos
C. Blog Articles

I started with A. If you sell to HR, Marketing, Sales professionals or B2B Founders... I suggest you do the same.

³ Tools you can use: Kleo / Taplio (ideation) + Canva (design)


2. Direct this traffic to an optimized website or LinkedIn profile

Make it clear who you sell to and how you can help.

If people visit your website, I'd recommend filming a 5-minute video sales letter (VSL) that showcases how you can help. (This does wonders for improving conversions!)

Whether people visit your website or LinkedIn profile, you can:
- create a lead magnet to grab their email address
- identify + qualify people who showed interest

³ Tools you can use: Instantly.ai / Vector ={ (cheap / free visitor identification)


3. Enrich leads & reach out to qualified prospects

Reach out to every prospect that seems to be a good target... but hasn't messaged you yet.

I'd send the first 50 messages manually before looking to automate anything.

Since they saw your profile / website + they're a good fit, you can write a message that combines personalization based on their {action} and their specific {situation}.

Something short, such as:
""Hey {{first_name}}, seems my latest post on {topic} resonated. It probably came at the right time since you're currently doing {initiative}? 

Either way, happy to exchange ideas if you'd like. 

Cheers""

The magic when you send these notes manually is that you constantly improve/rework your message - and you end up uncovering patterns. You can later use these to scale/automate your outreach.

³ Tools you can use: 
- Prospeo.io / Icypeas / LeadMagic / FullEnrich (to find emails)
- Instantly.ai / Woodpecker.co / Smartlead (to send emails) 
- HeyReach (to send LinkedIn notes)
- lemlist (for LinkedIn + Emails)


4. Repeat Steps 1-3 for long enough until you inevitably improve.

urn:li:ugcPost:7296107013502103552,"The #1 reason your cold email campaigns don't get responses:

You're stuck in the spam folder.
No one sees them. 

Here are 7 ways to avoid that:

1ã Build your email infrastructure with secondary mailboxes/domains:

Instantly.ai done-for-you offering helps with that.
ColdIQ also has a premium offering if you wish to outsource your deliverability setup.

You can also set it up on your own by buying new domains & setting up a mix of Google + Outlook mailboxes.


2ã Warm up your domain and limit your daily sends

Platforms like lemlist, Instantly, Woodpecker.co, Smartlead & MailReach have warm-up features that help improve your domain reputation.

If you don't like the idea of 'artificial email warm-up'  try not doing it, but make sure you send a low volume of emails and increase it slowly/progressively.


3ã Clean your lead lists before sending

Emails that bounce are a huge tell that youre reaching out cold. 

Jesse Ouellette explained it well: Imagine you send an email to a person you know& how likely it is that you get their email address wrong? 

Pretty low, right? Well thats how Google/Outlook know what you're doing.

’ Takeaway: Use reputable tools to find + validate emails (e.g: LeadMagic, FullEnrich, Prospeo.io, Icypeas)


4ã Optimise your email copy

That means:
- Very few spam words (Instantly.ai, Folderly & Mailmeteor have a free tool to remove these)
- Spintax variation (Instantly can automate this for you)
- Plain text writing without HTML
- As few links as possible
- No open rate tracking


5ã Match your email service providers with the ones your prospects use

Send to Google Mailboxes using a Google Mailbox
Send to Outlook mailboxes using an Outlook mailbox.

Instantly.ai & Smartlead can take care of it for you.


6ã (Last but not least) Ask yourself& would I want to receive this email?


These 'optimisations' wont matter if your emails aren't worth reading.

Put yourself in the shoes of your prospects: 
Youre sending an unsolicited email to someone who feels they receive too many.

Most outreach doesn't care about the recipient.

If you provide value, you can break all the rules& and youll get responses anyway.

urn:li:ugcPost:7295483188737437696,"I've grown my company to $3.6M+ ARR by reverse engineering successful sales software case studies.

Obviously, I didn't do JUST that.

But looking at sales technology has been my favourite way to find new go-to-market plays. 

My assumption is that if a company keeps paying for a revenue tool& they must be making money from it.

And if a revenue platform generates lots of revenue... they serve many companies that make money.

A couple of examples:

1. Intent signals tools help you find in-market companies. 

This results in messages being more relevant to your targets = more replies = more meetings = new clients = more money.

2. Email warmup tools help you improve your deliverability. 

This results in more messages being opened = more interested prospects = more clients = more money.

This logic holds true accross 75+ categories of sales software.

And if you dont understand how you to use these tools& most will show you themselves... since it's in their own interest to help you be successful with them.

So, how shall you use this to your advantage?

Simply:
1. Look at a nice directory of sales software (e.g: coldiq.com/ai-sales-tools =	)
2. Browse around various categories & individual software.
3. Study how the successful ones help sellers& sell more.
4. Good luck >

1ã A reliable B2B database

The biggest predictor of outreach campaign success relies on your ability to put your message in front of the right person.

I suggest B2B databases such as:

- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (Arguably the most up-to-date B2B database on earth)
- Ocean.io (A solid database to find niche data, with features that let you target similar companies to your existing clients)
- Apollo.io (Cost-effective database with similar data to LinkedIn).

Also heard great things about Keyplay & Cognism. 


2ã Clean data enrichment solutions

Youll likely contact your leads via phone, LinkedIn DMs or email.
This means you need valid email addresses, phone numbers or both.

Youll find some data from B2B databases. 

For the data you cant find, enrichment solutions come in handy (e.g: Prospeo.io, LeadMagic & Icypeas)

You can also use waterfall solutions that combine several enrichment tools in one. (FullEnrich, Clay & lemlist do that)



3ã AI Agents or Workflow Orchestration solutions

Agents & Workflow orchestration solutions have been popularised in 2024.

Examples include tools like Clay, Relevance AI, Unify & Common Room.

Creating cold outreach campaigns used to be fragmented across 5-6 tools and involved moving around .csv files.

Youd build a list on a platform. Import it to another to find emails. Then, a 2nd one to verify these emails. Finally, youd import it to your engagement platforms& but not before trying to find unique data points to leverage in your outreach.

Whether you use agents or workflow builders, youll save time by not repeating unnecessary manual tasks. 

Also, they allow you to perform deep research & qualification, mimicking an army of assistants, as you learn how to properly prompt/configure these tools.


4ã Sales Engagement platforms

Whether you plan to engage your prospects via email (Instantly.ai), LinkedIn (HeyReach), or both (lemlist)& Theres a tool that will help you automate a good chunk of actions.

An essential part of cold outreach via email is deliverability. Make sure your platform of choice invests resources on the matter.


5ã Technologies to close deals

Hopefully, your outreach campaigns give you plenty of leads to work.

Youll want one source of truth, typically a CRM.

Typical solutions include HubSpot. Newer ones include Attio, folk.
There's also a new breed of CRM, made for social media, like Breakcold.

Finally, a life-saver for your sales calls is to add a note-taking solution.

Attention does it for us. Other solid picks include Circleback, Fathom, tldv.

But in honour of the good news, here are my top 9 tips to grow and find clients here:

1. Be consistent for 3+ months before thinking of giving up

2. Study posts that performed great (use Kleo to find them) 

3. Create visuals to go with your posts (or outsource this)

4. Spend time engaging with people in your niche

5. Find recurring formats you can publish weekly

6. Reply to all your comments in the first 30 min

7. Repurpose your best content every 2 months

8. Connect with your ideal clients

9. Plan your content in advance

urn:li:ugcPost:7292539354172846083,"I spend > 200k per year on our outbound tech stack.

Most believe it's ""way too much"".

I agree with them.

We run outreach campaigns for 60+ clients
- in various niches, geos, and use-cases
- for companies under 20 people as well as org above 1,000 people.

Because of this, we need to be flexible.

Here's how I'd build a cold email stack if I could only spend $250/mo, $500/mo, $1,500/mo or $5,000/mo:


1ã [0 - $250/mo]

At this monthly spend, your best bet is to get an affordable all-in-one platform.

That is, a platform that combines:
- data sourcing
- sales engagement

My 2 favourites for that are 
- lemlist (starts at $69/mo)
- Instantly.ai (starts at $97/mo)

Total = $37 - $99/mo


2ã [$250 - $500/mo]

If you have slightly more budget to spend: 

I'd add an advanced data platform to Instantly / lemlist.

Their edge lies in their sales engagement features, while a platform like Clay will allow you to:
- access 100+ data platforms through one subscription
- scrape data at scale through their ai agent
- leverage ai models to score your leads

(and many more things)

Clay starts at $149/mo, but I recommend going for their $314/mo so that you gain access to their API.

Total: $186 - $448/mo


3ã [$500 - $1,500/mo]

If you do outbound at a decent scale, you'll likely have to spend more than > $500/mo.

If you have the budget, I recommend getting:
- [$99/mo] A B2B database such as Apollo.io or LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- [$100/mo] Data enrichment tools like FullEnrich, Prospeo.io or LeadMagic
- [$800/mo] Clay's Pro Plan (50K credits/month)
- [$0 - 149/mo] A visitor identification platform such as Vector ={ or RB2B
- [~$50 - $250/mo] A CRM like Breakcold, folk or HubSpot


Total: $1,140 - $1,489/mo


4ã [$1500 - $5000/mo]

Finally, for larger teams, I'd recommend adding:

- an intent platform such as Common Room to monitor buying signals at scale (starts at $999/mo)
- a sales proposal platform such as Qwilr to help close deals (starts at $117/mo)
- and, most probably, increase your Clay plan

Total: $2,611 - 4,258/mo

urn:li:activity:7292135939236061185,"I hit 30,000 LinkedIn followers 3 months after turning 30, on our first month crossing 300k in revenue after closing the year at > $3M in ARR.

I published 387 times. The 1st one was 3yrs ago. It took 3 attempts to succeed at being consistent on LinkedIn. On this successful attempt, I published 30+ times before seeing results (my 31st post went viral).

Thanks to LinkedIn, we booked > 1,200 meetings, signed 100+ B2B clients for our agency & 200+ coaching customers.

Heres why you should post and how:


WHY YOU SHOULD POST:

- Youre still early. As Noam Nisand points out, only 1% of people regularly post on LinkedIn. (Compared to 20% on Facebook, 25% on Instagram, & 34% on Twitter)

- Its free advertising. My content alone generated > 10M impressions. At an average CPM of $30, Id have to spend $300,000 in ads to get as much visibility.

- It enhances other marketing efforts. My outbound campaigns responses 3Xd as I started growing. People check you out and see social proof. Some know you& before you even reach out.

- It can book a lot (> 100/month) of very qualified leads. Some prospects dont even need to be sold to in calls. Theyve been exposed to so much content. They just need to know the price and how to get started.


HOW TO MAKE IT WORK:

- Go as in-depth as you can. You get fewer likes than creators who post memes, but your content translates to better conversations. Some creates have a smaller MRR than their number of followers. If you play your cards right, it should be the opposite. Look at how Adam Robinson or Gal Aga write. Thats what you should strive towards.

- Invest in creating original visuals. Most posts with a good visual will get pushed to 3-4X more people. Everyone says video is king. In my experience, infographics & carousels are. Check out Pierre Herubel & Nick Broekema for what great visuals look like.

- Take pride in your consistency. Audience building is a long-term game, and you probably wont generate any revenue from the platform in your first few weeks. Be patient and view it as a trust-building mechanism before it becomes an inbound channel.

- Study what great posts look like. Extensions like Kleo help find top-performing content. Look at the hooks, format, visuals, length and style of these posts. Gain inspiration. Never copy.

- Connect with your ICP. They'll view your publications. Think of the impact of 100s ideal clients regularly reading how you can solve their pain points. 

- Repurpose your best pieces. 3 of my most successful posts are infographics breaking down a Tech Stack. Its almost the same, but it reached 100k impressions every time. Most have forgotten your initial post. New followers haven't seen it. Test it: take your best post. Publish it again. Itll likely perform just as well as the first time.

Here's how to replicate it =G

(Pick max. 1-2 tools per category)


1ã DATA

You need a solid data source. My favourites include:

A. Clay (I recommend going for their $349/mo plan)

They're great for TAM Sourcing, Intent Data, and leveraging AI Agents. Plus, they aggregate 100+ enrichment platforms within one subscription.

³ Great bet to find even hard-to-find data points.


B. LinkedIn Sales Navigator (starts at $99/mo)

Where many B2B databases get their data from. You'd be smart to do the same.


C. Ocean.io

B2B database with lots of industry filtering options. Especially helpful to find niche data. Plus, their 'lookalike' feature finds similar companies to your targeted companies.


2ã ENRICHMENT

You might want to enrich additional data points for your lists. For these, I recommend:

- FullEnrich (starts at $29/mo)
- Prospeo.io (starts at $39/mo)
- LeadMagic ($99.99/mo for 10k credits)


These 3 can be used within Clay, through their API. 

To save some money on your Clay subscription, I recommend purchasing the data straight from these vendors.


3ã SIGNALS

Monitoring buying signals is a great way to find 'in-market' companies. A few platforms help with that, such as:

A. Common Room

Very extensive signal platform. They let you layer intent signals on your prospects, which help make your outreach more relevant.

All-in-one platform that aggregates > 10 intent signal sources to help you build relevant lead lists. You can then engage the leads through their sequencing product.


C. Trigify.io (starts at $69/mo)

Signal platform that focuses most on social engagement.


(Also, many signals can be leveraged within Clay)


4ã OUTREACH

Once you've got the lead lists ready, you'll want to engage your leads... while staying out of spam. Depending on your favourite channel, I recommend:

A. EMAIL

Instantly.ai (starts at $37/mo)

Most comprehensive solution for email sending. Includes email warm-up, inbox rotation, done-for-you deliverability set up, email validation.


B. LINKEDIN

HeyReach (starts at $79/mo)

Great outreach solution to scale your LinkedIn sending, without scaling costs as fast.


C. MULTI-CHANNEL

lemlist (starts at $69/mo)

Great all-in-one platform to engage leads across several channels (email + Linkedin + phone). Also includes a B2B lead database & warm-up capabilities.


5ã CLOSING

Finally, you could use some tech help to manage your pipeline & close deals. Here are some that help us do that:

Default (starts at $665/mo)
³ Great for automated inbound lead routing

HubSpot (starts at $90/mo) 
³ CRM solution that natively integrates with a lot of tech

Breakcold (starts at $29/mo)
³ CRM solution built for social selling

Qwilr (starts at $39/mo)

1ã Website visitor identification

Tools you can use:
- Common Room
- Instantly.ai
- Unify
- RB2B
- Koala
- Warmly,
- MeetVisitors
- Identity Matrix

When it works best: 
³ For 'larger' companies (100+) that have lots of website traffic (> 50k monthly)

Why it works:
³ Prospects already have context on you. The page they visited gives an extra nugget of information you can leverage in your outreach.

How to make it work:
³ Triangulate information around 1. the page they visited and what they were browsing for and 2. what's currently happening in their organization (layer several signals).


2ã Champion tracking

Tools you can use:
- Common Room
- UserGems =Ž
- Champify
- Unify
- Clay

When it works best: 
³ When a (happy) user of your product moves to a new company.

Why it works:
³ They love your product already. They'll likely find it helpful if they hold a similar position.

How to make it work:
³ Congratulate them on their new position. Remind them of the features they used to enjoy and be 'soft' on your approach.


3ã Job openings

Tools you can use:
- People Data Labs
- Common Room
- PredictLeads
- LoneScale
- Unify
- Clay

When it works best: 
³ When your solution can help improve the productivity/output of the person who's about to get hired.

Why it works:
³ The opening signals an initiative in a specific department.

How to make it work:
³ Read the job description to get a better idea of the responsibilities & priorities of the new hire. Position your product as a way to help, not replace. 


4ã News & funding announcement

Tools you can use:
- Owler - A Meltwater Offering
- Common Room
- Crunchbase
- PitchBook
- Clay

This could be acquisitions, new product launches, or mergers. 

When it works best: 
³ When the event precedes spending in an area relevant to your offering.

Why it works:
³ More funding equates to a bigger budget, which means a higher propensity to spend.

How to make it work:
³ If it's a piece of big news, your targets will get 100s of similar messages. When everyone zig, you zag. Make sure to stand out by mentioning less obvious things.

urn:li:activity:7290368739227693056,"Ive grown my agency to > $3m/year in 2024.

Here are my 5 biggest pieces of advice to beat 99% “


1ã Be the best at a sub-category of your service.

Naval wrote: Be the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.

You wont be the best agency from day 1.

But you could be the best at part of your offering.

E.g: with ColdIQ, I never said we're the best outbound agency in the world.

But I embraced sales tech from day 1  and positioned us as the most tech-savvy outbound agency.

This meant having 'polarizing' view on outbound.

Some hate it. But organizations that embrace new technologies would think of us first.

With agencies, you dont need many clients to make good revenue.

³ Takeaway: Better to be hated and loved& than to be neutral to everyone.


2ã Brand building efforts compound. Invest in these asap.

Our first client paid $1,200.
This week were receiving a $49k payment.

Every 22-year-old can create an offer and make big claims.

It's tougher to:
- Educate your ICP with valuable content.
- Last years within a specific niche.
- Accumulate client testimonials.

Prospects look at these things to decide between you and your competition.

³ Takeaway: To get paid more, you need to solve bigger problems. And to be trusted to solve these, you need to have a track record.


3ã Dont accept anyone as client.

Equally important as who you take on is who you dont.

The wrong clients =
³ take more time
³ consume more resources
³ have higher likelihood of being dissatisfied.

If your campaign dont perform, you will be held responsible.
(But sometimes, its not you& its them)

Get stricter on who you accept as clients& 
Youll lose out on some cash in the short term.

But your life will be easier for it.

³ Takeaway: Youre in the business of scaling businesses. Not saving them.


4ã Hire A-Players

Nothing wrong with hiring overseas.

But if relying on cheap labor is your main strategy, youre in for a race to the bottom.

In most businesses, talent make or break companies.
Its even more the case for agencies

Its not about how good you are at the skill. 
Its how good you are at delivering it at scale.

You pay more salaries, but clients stay longer.

³ Takeaway: Pay more. It costs more, but clients stay longer, and this make you more profitable in the long run.


5ã Join forces with people who complement your skills.

Business is a lonely journey. 
Growing an agency is tough.

Try finding someone complimentary to you, and build together.

As an example Im not a great manager. 

Im chaotic, and I cant stand doing anything admin-related.

But Alex is great at the above.

This means I could free up time thinking strategy, vision & top-of-funnel.
And weve grown 20x quicker than Id have solo.

Then, with people like Dan & Fivos, growth accelerated even faster.

³ Takeaway: Focus on what you do best, find people better than you at the rest.

Nothing against the former.

In the meantime, when it comes to mobile data& its important to note that providers have vastly different coverage across regions.

If your data solution has good coverage in the US& you cant conclude theyll have good data in the EU.

It's a $36.6B+ market, predicted to hit > $141B by 2030*

As a European, I'm sad to admit it:

The US dominates the Sales SaaS landscape:

Salesforce, LinkedIn, Hubspot, ZoomInfo, and Outreach all come from the US.

That said& some great sales platforms came out of Europe.

Some of my favourites include:


1ã Instantly.ai

3 out of the 4 co-founders are from Europe (Nils<è<í, Raul <ê<ê, Reio <ê<ê). 

They popularized the concept of inbox rotation and have seen insane growth as a result.

It's the #1 cold email platform Id recommend.


2ã FullEnrich

Benjamin <ë<÷, Grégoire <ë<÷ & the team made a homerun in 2024.

They went from 0 to 7 figures in a year by building the best data waterfall platform on the market.


3ã Genesy

A newcomer in the space whose ambition is simple& dethroning the hottest success story of 2024 (a.k.a Clay)

We share the same coworking space (Norrsken Barcelona) with Kai <ê<ø and his team in Barcelona. With their 5M¬ funding, theyll be making some noise! 


4ã HeyReach

$0 to $3M ARR in 18 months& Nick  <ò<ð, Ilija <ò<ð & and team did to LinkedIn outreach what Instantly did to cold emails.

They let you scale your sending without scaling your costs. 

The value proposition is compelling, considering the huge growth they had last year.


5ã Trigify.io

Before building a strong social intent signal solution, Max <ì<ç was creating insanely complicated automated workflows that couldnt be made before Clay (except by him, of course).

His software is now being adopted in the tech stack of more & more companies.

urn:li:activity:7289658345412591616,"US <ú<ø vs Europe <ê<ú for Sales Software, who's best?

It's a $36.6B+ market, predicted to hit > $141B by 2030*

As a European, I'm sad to admit it:

The US dominates the Sales SaaS landscape:

Salesforce, LinkedIn, Hubspot, ZoomInfo, and Outreach all come from the US.

That said& some great sales platforms came out of Europe.

Some of my favourites include:


1ã Instantly.ai

3 out of the 4 co-founders are from Europe (Nils<è<í, Raul <ê<ê, Reio <ê<ê). 

They popularized the concept of inbox rotation and have seen insane growth as a result.

It's the #1 cold email platform Id recommend.


2ã FullEnrich

Benjamin <ë<÷, Grégoire <ë<÷ & the team made a homerun in 2024.

They went from 0 to 7 figures in a year by building the best data waterfall platform on the market.


3ã Genesy

A newcomer in the space whose ambition is simple& dethroning the hottest success story of 2024 (a.k.a Clay)

We share the same coworking space (Norrsken Barcelona) with Kai <ê<ø and his team in Barcelona. With their 5M¬ funding, theyll be making some noise! 


4ã HeyReach

$0 to $3M ARR in 18 months& Nick  <ò<ð, Ilija <ò<ð & and team did to LinkedIn outreach what Instantly did to cold emails.

They let you scale your sending without scaling your costs. 

The value proposition is compelling, considering the huge growth they had last year.


5ã Trigify.io

Before building a strong social intent signal solution, Max <ì<ç was creating insanely complicated automated workflows that couldnt be made before Clay (except by him, of course).

His software is now being adopted in the tech stack of more & more companies.


6ã Ocean.io

1ã Content 

lemlist has historically dominated LinkedIn organic (250k+ combined followers)

³ So much so that they purchased Taplio (great for content ideation & planning).
³ Figma helps with designs.


For SEO, they use:
³ Semrush & Ahrefs (help with keyword research & rankings)
³ Google Search Console (helpful to monitor website organic performance)


2ã Outbound

For data, they use a lot (including competitors):

’ B2B databases: Apollo.io, People Data Labs, and their own.
’ Fundraising data: Crunchbase
’ Technology data: BuiltWith

For advanced use-cases (e.g: niche sourcing, AI agent) they use Clay.

For deliverability: 
³ lemwarm (one of the 1st email warming platforms) 
³ Infraforge (currently integrating) to allow clients to purchase secondary domains/mailboxes.

Theyre big on intent signals since they use 5+ solutions such as:
’ LoneScale (tracks job changes, new hires & job postings)
’ Snitcher & Revenue Institute (visitor identification)
’ G2

They use most large AI models (= OpenAI, Anthropic's Claude, Mistral AI).


3ã Product

For production data, they use:

- Google Cloud Platform (= build/deploy applications in the cloud)
- Holistics Data (= Business Intelligence platform they use for analytics)
- RudderStack (= customer data platform for data transformation)
- dbt Labs (= data transformation as well)
- BigQuery (= data warehouse)

For prototyping, they use:

- Replit (= platform to develop & deploy software)
- Vercel V0 (= user interface & code generation)


4ã Inbound Funnel

The website is hosted on Webflow, but they use WordPress as their CMS.

Mixpanel & Google Analytics track their product & website metrics.

They use Customer.io as their (inbound) email marketing solution.

They recently added Default to their tech stack (helps with lead routing).

Plus, they leverage Hightouch as a reverse ETL platform (= extracts, transforms, loads centralized data into all the other apps so that every department has synced data).


5ã Sales

They use: 

³ HubSpot (as their CRM)
³ lemcal (for meeting scheduling)
³ Spoke (to record & transcribe meetings)
³ Qobra (for sales compensation/commissions)


6ã Finance

Their finance apps include:

- Qonto (= business bank account)
- Pennylane (= all-in-one accounting solution)
- ProfitWell by Paddle (= subscription analytics)


7ã BONUS: Team Communications, Customer Support, Automation

urn:li:activity:7288244600454946818,"We grew from 0 to $3M in under 2 years.

Heres what Id do if I had to start all over again:

For context& our growth looked something like:

- $0 ’ $7,800/mo (found first 2 clients with outbound)
- $7,800 ’ $40,000/mo (started posting content alongside outbound)
- $40,000 ’ $90,000/mo (had team members post content as well)
- $90,000 ’ $150,000/mo (came up with new coaching offer)
- $150,000 ’ $220,000/mo (started running ads + ramping up SEO)
- > $220,000/mo (new offers: email infrastructure + done-for-you ads)


But these 4 main things will help you grow to 7-figure “

1ã Create content asap

Every person you reach out cold, will check you out.

In the beginning, you wont have the biggest brand out there.

Creating good content around your prospects pain point is the fastest way to build trust.

Start by posting 3x/week& without allowing yourself to give up.

The magic is in showing up every day.

Youll know what great content looks like when you hit publish > 100 times.


2ã Connect with your ICP on Linkedin

Your first pieces will be seen by few people.

The goal of content, in the beginning, is to act as a trust mechanism, not a lead generation mechanism.

Your content will attract inbound leads. Just not straight away.

But it'll help improve your conversation rates when you contact strangers.

Whether its a connection request, a LinkedIn DM, a comment& people check you out.

And if they see 20+ solid pieces of content around your topic of expertise, theyll trust that you know what youre talking about.

(P.S: You can use lemlist / HeyReach for connection requests)


3ã Create a service-based lead magnet*

The idea is to provide some value first without asking for anything in return.

You can do so by providing part of your service for free.

Think about the first thing youd do for a client if you were to sign them. Do it already. Then, give it away to your prospects.


4ã Leverage signals to reach out at the right time

As you ramp up your lead gen efforts (DMs, emails, content, comments), you get more exposure to potential clients.

Theyll start interacting with you in different ways by:

A. Visiting your LinkedIn
³ Combine Sales Navigator & Prospeo.io / FullEnrich to enrich your profile viewers contact information

B. Liking / Commenting your posts
³ You can use tools like Common Room / Trigify.io to track social interactions.

C. Visiting your website
³ Add a lead magnet to capture emails & use Instantly.ai / RB2B to identify website visitors.

For all above instances, you can gently re-engage them with a message like:


Hey {{first_name}}, seems you were {looking at my profile}.

Curious if something caught your interest?

Cheers


Often, thats all it takes to start new conversations.

And& the more conversations you have ’ the more sales youll make.

Focus on improving a little bit every day. 

And with enough patience, persistence & consistency& youll make it >á

urn:li:ugcPost:7287494674796142592,"How to get your LinkedIn DMs answered:

(Based on the > 100 messages I get weekly)


BACKGROUND:

I personally sent > 1.5M outreach messages for ColdIQ.

Nowadays... I spend more time responding than running campaigns.

I run a 21-person company.

(Imagine how much outreach 100+ people CEOs get)

I can't speak for them, but I do look at my inbox...

And I respond to cold DMs 
(not always super fast, but I do!)

Here's how I decide if I'll reply and how I changed my own outreach based on this “


 Relevant DMs offering *free* work

Some DMs I've gotten offered to re-write a landing page for free.

For some of the best DMs... they went as far as sending samples of 'already-made' work.

We ran campaigns offering free custom lead lists... and we had more replies than we knew what to do with!

Pro tip: Think about the first you'd do if you signed your prospect as a client. And do it already (if it's not too time-consuming, ofc)


L Templated generic DMs

I don't enjoy ghosting people. But if you're sending a copy/pasted template to everyone, chances are it'll be completely irrelevant.

(I keep receiving offers for ColdIQ's SaaS... while we don't have one... yet!)


 Relevant DMs asking to be referred.

If it's a relevant message based on a current initiative of ours... and you notice that someone else on my team owns the initiative... I'll happily refer you their way.

Pro tip: You can 'automate' this process
³ Within Clay you can orchestrate combining intent signals with finding a colleague in a relevant department.


L DMs asking for time on the 1st touchpoint

I try to have as few meetings as possible every week.
I find it draining to be back-to-back in meetings.

If the first thing you do is ask me for my time without much more context, I'll find a way out.


= Voice Notes in the DMs

If you send me one, I'll listen (also can't help myself from listening).

Once again, not sure I'll reply, but it creates a pattern interrupt in my inbox.

lemlist has a feature that lets you send several at once.

= Video DMs

No guarantee that I'll reply, but I watch most videos (I can't help myself).
I've seen that videos work pretty well to grab people's attention.

You can use Sendspark or Loom for that.


 DMs from 'important' people

This is a bit unfair.

But I look at WHO sent the message as much as WHAT's in the message.

Say you're an Exec at a large company or a 'well-known' Founder... I'll most probably reply.

Pro tip: If your audience is on LinkedIn, building your brand will benefit both your inbound & your outbound motions.

(The more I grow on the platform, the better my response rate is)

urn:li:ugcPost:7287126171102642176,"We use 46+ separate apps to run our 7-figure agency.

Most believe it's ""too much tech""

And I think they're right.

Especially if all you're looking to do is run some high-converting outbound campaigns.

As an outbound agency with over 50 clients, we run campaigns:
- in various niches
- targeting different geos
- across multiple use cases
- for businesses targeting various organization sizes

Clients' requirements vary.
And we need to be flexible.

Thus our prospecting tool stack alone relies on 25+ software.

Now most companies don't need as much sales tech.

I'd argue, most can get away with 1-3 tools tops.

And it's much more practical to run your prospecting engine without switching between 15 separate tools.

If that's you, here are my top picks for all-in-one prospecting tools (a.k.a tools that do it all!):


1. lemlist: They have a 450M+ people database, multi-channel outreach features as well as email deliverability features. 

This means you can find & enrich leads, automate your outreach across multiple channels, and ensure you land outside of spam by paying for JUST one subscription.


2. Instantly.ai: They have an extensive B2B database and plenty of VERY advanced cold email features such as built-in catch-all verification, website visitor identification, done-for-you email setup + premium deliverability AND a CRM.

If you plan to run cold email campaigns, it's the only tool you need.


3. Unify: Their end-to-end platform lets you leverage intent data (for example, G2, Champions & website visitors) to build some advanced engagement workflows. They also added an AI agent to their product.

I've added a few other alternatives which are worth exploring as well “

urn:li:activity:7285343166042419201,"Heres what a $30m/year SaaS acquisition funnel looks like:

It currently brings 1,500 new paying customers per month “

(FYI  This is lemlists funnel, broken done by the CEO himself: Charles Tenot)


1ã Top-of-funnel

lemlist gets ~200,000 monthly visitors to their website.

Their main traffic channels are:

A. LinkedIn
³ Kévin, Lucas, Tal, Roxana, Charles & Guillaume regularly post(ed) educational content around marketing, growth & prospecting. 

(Together, they have a combined audience of > 250,000 followers)


B. Paid Marketing
³ They spend around 20k¬/mo in ads on Meta, Google & LinkedIn. Google is great for targeting bottom-of-funnel intent searches. LinkedIn is good for targeting larger companies.


C. SEO
³ 15-20% of their signups now come from SEO. One breakthrough theyve had was creating multi-lingual content. They now get > 25% of new signups from Germany. 

As part of SEO, they have free mini-tools that focus on niche lead generation use cases and contribute to bringing visitors to their site.


D. Affiliates
³ 10% of their traffic comes from partners & happy customers that spread the word about lemlist (they gain a recurring percentage on deals).


E. Webinars
³ They run a series of webinars with top voices in the sales space& hosted by Tal.


F. YouTube
³ G has a > 40k YouTube channel. Plus, lemlist has its own channel with ~13k subscribers.


G. Guillaume Moubeche
³ If youve been following this space, you know who G is. He regularly appears on podcasts, has a large following on social and has been the media engine behind lemlist since the start.


2ã Middle-of-funnel

They have around 7-8% conversion rate from their visits, amounting to ~14,000 monthly new signups.

They get very qualified traffic to their website. But also make it easy to create an account “

’ Their 14-day free trial grants access to the entire platform without having to input credit card details.

’ Once it ends, their reverse trial switches you to their $0 plan, where you keep access to basic features.


If you prefer, you can book a demo. This can be done:
- in-app
- via the website
- through their onboarding emails

50% of demos come from people who already have an account. 
The remaining 50% dont.

For larger accounts, they create dedicated landing pages to push them straight to a demo.


3ã Bottom-of-funnel

lemlist uses 3rd party data to enrich interested accounts.

They then score them according to some specific thresholds.

The ones that pass these get a 1:1 demo.

For smaller accounts, they run Group demos (7 to 20 people)

At the moment, over 10% of lemlists global revenue is sales-assisted.


This funnel is currently responsible for 1,500 new paying users.

In total, lemlist has around 20,000 active paying users.

Heres the step-by-step breakdown of what we did “

We leveraged LinkedIn DMs, LinkedIn invites, Profiles views and of course& cold emails.

This was all orchestrated within lemlist “

Day 1:
³ Visit our target LinkedIn profile.
³ Send an email right after the profile view.

(Note: I included the copy in the slides below)

Day 2:
³ Send a LinkedIn connection request.

Day 4:
³ Send a follow-up email to re-iterate our value proposition, through a different angle.

Now, after the first few touchpoints, one of 2 things typically happens:

A. Our connection request isn't accepted.
³ We try one last time by sending a Loom video showcasing how we can help.

(This is Day 9)

B. Our connection request is accepted “

’ We send them a DM on LinkedIn (D+1 acceptance).
’ If no reply: we follow-up with another DM (D+4 acceptance).
’ If sill no reply: we follow-up with a last email (D+6 acceptance)

The last email is also a Loom walkthrough (as in the situation in which our request wasnt accepted).

Harry Mason is our internal LinkedIn expert
(and is the mastermind who made this campaign a success)

He compiled all his learnings in a document.
(That we use for internal training)

urn:li:activity:7285343166042419201,"Heres what a $30m/year SaaS acquisition funnel looks like:

It currently brings 1,500 new paying customers per month “

(FYI  This is lemlists funnel, broken done by the CEO himself: Charles Tenot)


1ã Top-of-funnel

lemlist gets ~200,000 monthly visitors to their website.

Their main traffic channels are:

A. LinkedIn
³ Kévin, Lucas, Tal, Roxana, Charles & Guillaume regularly post(ed) educational content around marketing, growth & prospecting. 

(Together, they have a combined audience of > 250,000 followers)


B. Paid Marketing
³ They spend around 20k¬/mo in ads on Meta, Google & LinkedIn. Google is great for targeting bottom-of-funnel intent searches. LinkedIn is good for targeting larger companies.


C. SEO
³ 15-20% of their signups now come from SEO. One breakthrough theyve had was creating multi-lingual content. They now get > 25% of new signups from Germany. 

As part of SEO, they have free mini-tools that focus on niche lead generation use cases and contribute to bringing visitors to their site.


D. Affiliates
³ 10% of their traffic comes from partners & happy customers that spread the word about lemlist (they gain a recurring percentage on deals).


E. Webinars
³ They run a series of webinars with top voices in the sales space& hosted by Tal.


F. YouTube
³ G has a > 40k YouTube channel. Plus, lemlist has its own channel with ~13k subscribers.


G. Guillaume Moubeche
³ If youve been following this space, you know who G is. He regularly appears on podcasts, has a large following on social and has been the media engine behind lemlist since the start.


2ã Middle-of-funnel

They have around 7-8% conversion rate from their visits, amounting to ~14,000 monthly new signups.

They get very qualified traffic to their website. But also make it easy to create an account “

’ Their 14-day free trial grants access to the entire platform without having to input credit card details.

’ Once it ends, their reverse trial switches you to their $0 plan, where you keep access to basic features.


If you prefer, you can book a demo. This can be done:
- in-app
- via the website
- through their onboarding emails

50% of demos come from people who already have an account. 
The remaining 50% dont.

For larger accounts, they create dedicated landing pages to push them straight to a demo.


3ã Bottom-of-funnel

lemlist uses 3rd party data to enrich interested accounts.

They then score them according to some specific thresholds.

The ones that pass these get a 1:1 demo.

For smaller accounts, they run Group demos (7 to 20 people)

At the moment, over 10% of lemlists global revenue is sales-assisted.


This funnel is currently responsible for 1,500 new paying users.

In total, lemlist has around 20,000 active paying users.

- Studied formatting, hook & visuals of best-performing LinkedIn posts.
- Used tools such as Kleo & Taplio to find these posts.
- Focused topics around buyers' biggest pain points.
- Published consistently and kept on iterating.


2. We promoted our best-performing posts through ads

- Reviewed our post performances monthly.
- Analyzed which personas booked meetings from which posts.
- Boost said post before said persona (using LinkedIn thought leader ads)


3. We identified LinkedIn engagers & website visitors

- Used platforms like Teamfluence / Common Room to 'capture' social interactions (profile views, company mentions, engagement, followers).
- Used platforms such as Instantly / RB2B to identify our website visitors.


4. Routed Contacts to Clay


5. Leveraged AI Models to Segment, Score & Tier leads

- Used Claygent & other APIs to gain more context on our inbound leads.
- Used OpenAI / Claude to segment leads into several tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).
- Ignored Tier 3, emailed Tier 2, & engaged Tier 1 on multi-channel (LinkedIn, Email, Phone).


6. Enriched Qualified Leads

- Used Prospeo / FullEnrich / LeadMagic to find phone numbers & email addresses.


7. Sent Email & LinkedIn Outreach (Personalized)

- Kept our outreach short, contextual & valuable (using lead magnets).
- Used lemlist for multi-channel outreach.
- Used Instantly for email-only outreach.

Add these ones to your Tech stack:


1ã A powerful AI Sales Agent

Vertical agents will revolutionise sales in 2025. 

They can be leveraged for:

- reply handling & categorization
- account & prospect research
- lead scoring & segmentation
- outreach personalization

They typically work by:

’ figuring out actions to take based on a prompt.
’ performing these actions autonomously.
’ providing an output and a description of how it got there.

Here are some to look into:

- Roomie AI by Common Room to add more context to prospects signals.
- Unifys AI agent to personalize messages at scale.
- Clays AI Agent (Claygent) for prospect research.
- Octaves AI agent for deep ICP research.
- Ava by Artisan to automate outbound.

(If you plan to automate outbound campaigns entirely, make sure to check the outputs of the AI-generated messages manually)


2ã An accurate B2B Database

Successful outbound campaigns start with the correct data.

You can use platforms such as LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Apollo.io, Ocean.io or Telescope to build your prospects lists.


3ã An advanced Data Enrichment software

Finding valid contact data paired with extensive context on every single one of your prospects& is a great combination to reach your leads, at the right time.

No one does that better than Clay. They let you find data by leveraging 100+ enrichment tools within one platform AND orchestrate complex workflows.


4ã A Sales Engagement platform (that keeps you out of SPAM)

We run ColdIQs cold email campaigns with Instantly.ai.

When we want to reach prospects across several channels, we use lemlist.

Both include features that build sequences through AI.
Both include features that let you warm up your mailboxes for improved deliverability.

Other great alternatives I recommend include Smartlead & Unify.


5ã Applications that help you manage leads & close deals.

To help with later stages of the sales funnel (lead management & closing) you can use a few tools such as:

- Default to qualify leads and route them to the right person.
- HubSpot as your CRM, to manage & review your pipeline.
- Common Room to aggregate intent from your prospects & decide when to re-active leads.
- Attention to record & summarize sales calls. As well as gather insights around your most frequently encountered objections.

urn:li:ugcPost:7277306243172511746,"2024 was the year of Founder-Led content. In 2025, I predict well see employees dominate LinkedIn.

Now, I dont think Founders posting content, as a trend, is going anywhere.
If anything, more and more executives will post content.

But heres the thing with Founders content&
Its mostly relatable to& other founders.

LinkedIn is made up of 1.15 billion monthly active users*.
And believe it or not& most arent founders.

As a marketer, you might enjoy seeing a founder posts about their marketing strategy.

But something youll enjoy even more: 
³ Other marketers, in the trenches, sharing whats working for them. 

The same logic applies to engineers, recruiters, sellers, HR & other professionals.

This presents an amazing opportunity for both employers & employees =G

’ As a company, you benefit from free advertising:

We generated > 12M impressions this year on LinkedIn. To replicate that with ad spend, it wouldve cost $360,000 in ad spend (at an average CPM of $30).

This also resulted in > 1,000 very qualified inbound meetings, contributing to + ~$150k in MRR.

’ As an employee, youre building an asset that YOU own:

And you should know that its very probable that someone, somewhere, is willing to pay much more than what youre currently getting for your existing skill set.

And if you ever want to launch your own project, youll already have an audience to which to expose it.

At ColdIQ, our team published on LinkedIn for the entire of 2024. 

We did learn a thing or 2 (that I shared with Arnaud), such as:

[00:00] Business impact from consistent posting.
[00:38] Attracting employees who want to grow their personnal brand.
[01:43] Making content creation as effortless as possible for your team.
[02:38] Impact from visual content assets on post performance.
[05:00] Quantity and quality of meetings booked with content.
[06:04] General increase in trust around the teams expertise.
[06:26] How it helps fix scaling issues for service providers.

Will you be posting in 2025?

And as with most agencies, the biggest challenge is&
³ Finding great talent.

But heres the thing about great talents&
They have options.

Its one thing to want a team of A+ players.
But, being an organization where they want to work is another story.

My favourite question to ask myself&
³ Would I want to be an employee of my own company?


When I started ColdIQ, I figured it was the perfect opportunity to create a work environment as close to what I wouldve wanted as an employee.

’ Flexible schedule.
’ No micro-management.
’ Flexibility to work remotely.
’ Ability to grow your personal brand.
’ Nice office with a view of the beach.
’ Competitive & meritocratic compensation.
’ A team of smart people you enjoy being around.
’ BONUS: A nice team building in the Greek Islands <ì<÷

I think we didnt do such a bad job.

And for our team, this meant that:

- Hugues get to spend time with his newborn baby.
- Harry got the opportunity to visit 11 countries this year.
- Monikas Instagram stories were always in a different city.
- Alex & I get to escape the cold and return when winter is over.
- Louis got to visit us from <ÿ<æ, Timothy from <ë<÷ & Soheil from <è<æ.
- Dujam, Dan, Fivos had the flexibility to go back and forth between Barcelona & <í<÷ <ì<ç <è<þ


2024 was a crazy year for us.
In large part due to the talented team we put together.

We have big goals for 2025.
And I believe well need even more talent to achieve these.


If you want to win, you must build a place that keeps being the best opportunity for your team.

urn:li:ugcPost:7274802012657967104,"In 2 years, I've grown my agency from $0 to > $3m/year.

This made me realize:

It's actually not that hard to get ahead of 90% of your competition =G


Here are my 5 biggest pieces of advice for anyone starting or growing an agency:


1ã Dominate a 'sub-category' of your service.

Early on we took a 'polarizing' stance on how we do and view outbound.

Instead of making the same claims as other agencies:

""we're the best outbound agency in the world""

We embraced sales technology (a sub-set of outbound)  and positioned ourselves as the most ""technology-savvy outbound agency"".

Some ""old school"" sellers hate this view of outbound.
But for organization that embrace new technologies... we're top of mind.

And in the commoditized agency game, you only need a few clients to make substantial revenue.

³ Takeaway: You don't need to please everyone!


2ã Invest in your brand, ASAP.

Every 20-year old can spin off a website and claim they're better than you.

But it's more difficult to:
- Educate their ICP with great content over a sustained period of time.
- Prove experience and longevity within a specific niche/space.
- Accumulate as many real client testimonials.

In such a commoditized space, this is how prospects decide between you and your competition.


3ã Know who NOT to take as clients.

This is as important as who you take on.

Bad clients:
= more time
= more resources
= higher likelihood of being unhappy.

You're not in the business of SAVING businesses.
You're in the business of SCALING businesses.

I've told the story of how I learned the story in the slides below.

But the takeaway is: If your campaigns don't perform, clients will hold you responsible (whether it's your fault or their product).

Apply strict criteria on who you take on as clients... you life will be easier for it.


4ã Hiring is the name of the game.

Arguably true for any business, but tru-er for agencies.
It's front-facing, and very tough to scale without human capital.

Many agencies rely on cheap overseas VA.

We decided to pay more to attract A players.

You pay more salaries, but clients stay longer... and this helps your bottom line over the long run.

³ Takeaway: It's not how good you are at the skill. It's how good you are at delivering it at scale.


5ã Join forces with the SMARTEST person you know.

Business can be a lonely journey. It's tough. And running an agency can get emotionally taxing.

If you can, find someone complimentary to you, and build together.

This was Alex for me, and we grew 10x faster that I could ever had on my own.

³ Takeaway: 1 + 1 is equal to more than 2 :)

1. Create High-Performing LinkedIn Posts

- Think about your buyers' biggest pain points.
- Use tools like Kleo & Taplio to find (viral) post ideas.
- Study their formatting, hook & visual assets.
- Be consistent and keep on iterating.

2. Promote Best-Performing Posts through Ads

- Review your post performance weekly or monthly.
- Analyze specific personas that booked meetings from specific posts.
- Boost said post before said persona (thought leader ads).

3. Identify Engaged Profiles & Website Visitors

- Use platforms like Teamfluence & Common Room to 'capture' social interactions (profile views, company mentions, engagement, followers).
- Use platforms such as RB2B, Common Room or Instantly to identify website visitors.

4. Send Contacts to Clay

5. Leverage AI Models within Clay for Research & Account Scoring

- Leverage Claygent & APIs to get more context on your leads.
- Use OpenAI or Claude to segment leads into several tiers.
- Don't contact Tier 3, email Tier 2, engage Tier 1 on several channels (LinkedIn, Email, Phone).

6. Data Enrichment

- Use Prospeo, FullEnrich, and LeadMagic to find phone numbers (Tier 1) & email addresses (Tier 1 & 2).

7. Send Personalized Outreach

- Keep your outreach short and make it valuable.

- Use lemlist for multi-channel outreach.
- Use Instantly for email outreach.

Tech enthusiasts have already found success leveraging them to:

- handle & categorize prospects replies
- research their target organizations
- segment & score their prospects
- personalize their messaging


For the most part, they all work similarly by:

’ figuring out actions to do based on your input
’ performing said actions autonomously
’ providing results and describing how they came to these results.


If you dig deeper, they work best for specific use cases:


1ã Clays AI Agent (Claygent) effortlessly integrate with complex workflows and is best used to retrieve information based on prompting many records at once.

(Example: You could ask Claygent to visit 1,000 SaaS websites and output the lowest entry price it found for each one of these).


2ã Unifys AI Agent natively plugs into their orchestration workflows to research more information on each target account and help qualify these.


3ã Common Rooms Roomie AI helps add more context to the intent signals they already natively track on each prospect.

(Whats great with Common Room is how much context you can centralize on each of your prospect. They do that, thanks to the large number of signals they track. But sometimes signals dont fit into a category and are specific to your industry or the type of accounts you try to break into.

Pair that with an AI agent that fills the gap, and here you go)


4ã Octave focuses most of its work on ICP research. 

Where Clay gives you the flexibility of prompting into existence the information you want to surface&

Octave has pre-trained algorithms and pre-made prompts to help you nail ICP research.

Youre thinking about yourself instead of thinking of your prospect.

Heres what a typical outbound playbook looks like in (too) many companies:

’ Brainstorm the 2-3 best features theyll use in their messaging.
’ Identify their Ideal Client Profile based on company size, location & title
’ Send the same generic message to their newly created ICP list

Our best campaigns do none of these things =F

L I dont care much about location, company size and titles.
L I dont spend time wondering whats our BEST feature.
L Messages vary based on the target organization.


Ok& but why is it important?

Imagine an All-in-One platform like Apollo.

Their platform includes:

- A Sales Engagement platform
- An extensive B2B database

They could mention every single feature their platform has&

Or they could lead with their B2B database because thats what theyre most known for&

Or& they could simply research the target organization theyre about to contact.

³ No need to talk about their Sales Engagement Platform!

The opposite instance could happen where responsibilities for the new hire involve - for example - automating high-volume email campaigns.

urn:li:ugcPost:7270055059944542209,"I analyzed our 100 latest outbound campaigns to find out our top-performing intent signals:

Here are the results =G


1ã Re-engaging people visiting our (or a client's) website.

For this to work you need to have a lot of website visits.

We noticed this worked best with our largest clients (200+ people) as they tend to have more visits as well.

You can use the following tools to identify your anonymous website visitors:
- Common Room
- Instantly.ai 
- Unify
- RB2B
- Koala
- Warmly, 
- MeetVisitors

Then the magic happens once you triangulate information around:
’ what page did they visit
’ what they're looking for help with, given the page they were browsing
’ what's going on in their company at the moment (= layer additional signals)


2ã Job changes

That is:

- Someone who used your product at their previous job joins a new company

(Brian LaManna published my favourite template on how to re-engage them. You'll find it in the slides below)

or

- A new decision maker joined a new company recently (< 3 months)

You can use the following tools to track job changes:
- Common Room
- LoneScale
- Unify
- Clay


3ã Job openings

A very popular trigger that works well if you go further than just mentioning the fact that there are active openings at your target organization.

My favourite 'tactic' here is to analyze the job description to get an idea of the responsibilities & priorities of the new hire.

And then position your product/service as a way to enhance the new joiner.

You can track these with: 
- Common Room
- Unify,
- LoneScale
- Clay 


4ã News announcement

This can be many things (acquisition, new products, mergers... etc.)

It's more of a case-by-case basis, but the more 'niche' the news is, the better it tends to perform when you properly leverage it.

You can track news announcements with:
- Common Room
- Clay

You can also use their AI agents (Roomie AI & Claygent) to lookout for specific news across a list of companies.


*ã BONUS: More signals

If you want to brainstorm more signal ideas... Common Room has released the (most probably) best resource around intent/triggers.

Check out their ""Signal Spectrum"" Map, which will give you some good ideas about what to look for.

Here's why everybody at ColdIQ posts here =G

Imagine getting a cold email from Alex Hormozi, Adam Robinson or Guillaume Moubeche.

Let's go as far as to say it's one of the worst emails you received.

Would you reply?
I know I would.

Similarly, when I receive cold outreach from a salesperson at a well-known brand... 

I'm more likely to respond.


As our brand grew, cold emails got much easier.

The exact same message, to the same audience would perform twice as well.

³ Some would say 'yes' to a meeting, stating they're already familiar with what we do: ""Oh, I saw your posts on LinkedIn, guys""

³ Some would check us out after receiving a message and start reading our publications: ""I checked your LinkedIn, interesting stuff your posting on here""

And... we also started getting lots of inbound.

Which meant plenty of opportunities to learn about the pain points and the kind of profiles we can help the most.

Hint: We re-used some of these new audiences in our outbound campaigns.


I ran outbound for 150+ companies, and the raw truth is that some clients are getting disproportionally better results despite less effort on our end.

There are many factors, such as the market, the offer, and also... the BRAND.

Every agency with 20+ clients knows that a big factor in their success revolves around knowing who to take on as a client.

Am I wrong, Enzo, Lanny, Taylor, Alexander, Alex, Nick, Michael, >¾Eric, David, Kellen, Bjion, Josh?

Better clients:
= easier to get results for
= pay more money
= stay longer

And the key to finding these (better) clients is at the intersection of 'how many people know about you' and 'how many trust you to deliver results'

Content helps with both of these things.
And when your whole team does it, too

1ã Failure is part of a greater story.

Very few make it work on their first attempt. Even great entrepreneurs suffer. Steve Jobs was fired from his own company. Elon Musk's Space X's first 3 rocket launches failed and got him near bankruptcy.


2ã You win, or you learn.

Every failure brings you closer to success... as long as you take something away from your experience. I failed at a lottery business but learned Facebook Ads in the process. I failed a Facebook Ads agency but learned Cold Outreach. I now run a $3M/year outbound company. 


3ã You're dumb until you're a genius.

For every failed entrepreneurial venture, a smartass will tell you, ""It was obvious it wouldn't work"". Your peers are getting promoted, and you're spending months working WHILE losing money. (Why do that?)

When it works, you're a genius suddenly. You know you're the same... but perception has shifted.


4ã Impostor syndrome never goes away.

After publishing 200+ content pieces & growing to 25,000+ followers... I still wonder why people even take an interest in what I say. Feeling uncomfortable and continuing is the best sign you're growing.


5ã The people you surround yourself with are everything.

This is true of your loved ones and your team. Regarding the latter, you'll spend a lot of time with them.

Hiring makes or breaks your company; be intentional about teaming up with people who share your values.


6ã Building your brand is ONE of the greatest opportunities of our time.

Whether you own a business or are an employee. Somewhere in the world, someone is willing to pay 2X what you're getting for your skillset. But they don't know you exist, and you don't know they do.

More people knowing you improves your luck exposure.


7ã The more you give, the more you get.

Our content strategy revolves around giving away our playbooks for free. This results in > 100 meetings per month. Our best cold email campaigns offered something our prospects genuinely wanted.

The people in our team who got promoted the fastest were doing things we never required from them. Dan worked for free. Fivos took sales calls on top of handling his client work. They both now lead our organization.


8ã You're in it for the long run... so have fun.

The ones who stick the longest are the ones that win. It's not about being better. It's about doing more & better for longer. The easiest way to do that is to work on something you enjoy.


9ã You're one action away from changing your life. 

Send that cold message. Hit the publish button. Approach a stranger. You never know what can come out of it.

If you're wondering 'what if', it is your sign.

Levering intent signals to reach prospects at the right time.

Intent signals platforms help you:
- Uncover new pain points
- Identify relevant reasons to reach out
- Engage your CRM leads when their circumstances change

... and more.

GTM platforms tackle these in various ways:

The best, such as Common Room, let you track, visualize & layer 20+ separate signals across individual people & accounts.

Others, such as lemlist, Instantly.ai & Unify include signals as part of their all-in-one prospecting solutions.

Some, such as RB2B & Vector, focus on specific signal categories such as Visitor Identification (on & off-site).


Here are 12 platforms worth looking into:
- Common Room
- Instantly
- lemlist
- Vector
- Clay
- RB2B
- Warmly,
- Trigify.io
- Ocean.io
- LoneScale

urn:li:activity:7263175174542258176,"Effortless way to find 30-40% more valid emails:

A typical email finding workflow looks like this:
³ [1] Search your ideal client with LinkedIn Sales Navigator = 1,000 contacts
³ [2] Export the email addresses from the search = 550 found emails
³ [3] Verify emails you just found = 320 valid emails.

’ 1000 - 320 = 680 contacts you wont reach.

Does that sound familiar? 

Heres how to 2X your email finding rates =G

1ã Switch to better email finding platforms:

We use Prospeo.io to find 100,000 valid email addresses per month.
LeadMagic is another one of our favourites.

You cant go wrong with any of these 2.


2ã Leverage waterfall enrichment

Platforms such as FullEnrich & Clay aggregate 15+ solutions to lookup emails (& phone numbers).

If your first solution doesnt find a contacts email, the second one will look for it.

If the first 2 still havent found the email, the third will look for it.

And so on, until a valid email is found.


3ã Validate catch-all (= unverifiable) emails

A proportion of the email you find wont be verifiable by standard validation tools.

As a rule of thumb, you want to avoid sending emails if youre not sure whether the contact details are valid or not.

³ This is likely to increase your bounce rate, which in turn ’ increases your chances of being sent to the spam folder.

Instantly.ai recently deployed a Catch-All Verification feature that validates these emails nonetheless.

That results in recovering up to 40% more leads& you can now safely reach out to.

If youre not validating catch-all email addresses.

Picture this:
- You make a contact search
- Use a few providers to find email addresses
- And& 4 out of 10 emails return as CATCH_ALL

In other words, it means these are unverifiable by standard email validation tools. 

In such instances, it is best NOT to send to these email addresses.

This is likely to increase your bounce rate&

Which means higher odds of landing in spam with the rest of your outreach.

That said, a few weeks ago, Instantly.ai released a product feature that solves that.
(And its super easy to implement)

You just need:
- a list of your catch_all email addresses
- and some Instantly verification credits

You can then validate these emails (should take < 30 seconds), and youre ready to go.

What tools to get? =G


1ã First, you need (a) reliable data source(s)

’ LinkedIn is where many databases get their data. Get LinkedIn Sales Navigator and do the same.

’ Clay aggregates 75+ carefully vetted enrichment tools. From TAM sourcing to data enrichment, to intent data... to AI agents that research information for you... They're your best bet for even the hard-to-find data points.

’ Ocean.io has lots of industry filtering options. Worth exploring for unconventional niches. They also have a neat 'lookalike' feature that finds similar companies to your 'perfect' target companies.


2ã Second, enrich more data points from your lists

LinkedIn doesn't provide email addresses or phone numbers.

’ Tools such as Prospeo.io (our favourite) & LeadMagic (another favourite) are great for email & phone data.

’ For more coverage, use a 'waterfall' solution such as FullEnrich, which aggregates 15+ premium providers.


3ã Monitor buying signals to find 'in-market' companies

’ Common Room has the most extensive 'signal' solution. Their 'Person360' solution aggregates a wealth of information on each prospect. 

(e.g: 'are you in the same Slack community?' + 'did they visit your website?' + 'did they engage with your latest post?' + 'did they buy your solution at their previous company?' + 'did they just raise?')

’ Unify aggregates 10+ intent signal sources you can leverage straight from their platform through their outreach sequencing product.

’ RB2B de-anonymizes website visitors and provides their contact information. Instantly, Common Room & Unify do this as well.


4ã Engage your leads (while staying out of spam)

For email outreach:
- Instantly.ai has the most comprehensive solution for email sending. Including email warm-up, inbox rotation, done-for-you deliverability set-up, email validation & more.


For LinkedIn outreach:
- HeyReach allows you to scale your sending without scaling costs as fast.


For Multichannel outreach:
- lemlist has the most comprehensive solution for engaging leads across several channels. Under one platform, you can effortlessly reach your prospects via email, LinkedIn and phone.

If you want to stand out from the noise, you can leverage video outreach (Sendspark helps with that) or send voice DMs (lemlist can help).


5ã Finally, manage your pipeline & close all these deals

- For 'smart' lead routing, we use Default (which has casually 2X'd our inbound).

- AI recorders such as Attention are life-savers for taking notes during sales calls. 

(You can also re-use the notes gathered from these calls to uncover interesting insights such as 'what's the most frequent objection in your latest 100 sales calls')

- Difficult to go wrong with HubSpot (as a CRM), as it natively integrates with many tools.

- For social sellers, check out Breakcold, the only CRM built for social selling. 

- And to send neat proposals, Qwilr will get you sorted!

Skill stacking is one of my favourite concepts from Alex Hormozi.

- If youre good at math, youve got a good baseline skill.
- Combine math with bookkeeping, youre now an accountant.
- Then you learn about tax strategy and ways to shelter money.
- Then you learn about insurance and ways to use it to diversify risk.
- And then you learn about financing, investment banks & fundraising.

As you stack up these skills, your earning potential goes exponential.

Whether youre an employee or a business owner, I believe theres nothing more valuable than stacking skills.


I learned how to code and create websites years ago.

³ So I knew how to make a basic product


I taught myself Google & Facebook ads, and created > 250 pieces of content across 5+ social platforms.

³ So I developed decent marketing skills.


I sent > 1M cold emails and jumped in 150+ sales calls

³ Thus I learned enough to close deals.

You can entertain any business idea you have,

Without needing anyone else to get started.

Heres how Im making it happen =G


CURRENT SITUATION:

At the moment, we have 7 people in the team above 5k followers:

’ Michel: 25,200 followers
’ Alex: 23,926 followers
’ Fivos Aresti: 10,670 followers
’ Gerardo Teijeira: 8,832 followers
’ Dan Rosenthal: 7,649 followers
’ Ivan Falco: 6,695 followers
’ Soheil Saeidmehr: 5,945 followers

(Homage Monika who got banned at 9k =O)

The reason why I want to grow these numbers?

When Alex and I started posting consistently, we generated more leads than we knew what to do with.

When the team joined these efforts, we generated 4M+ impressions and added > $80k in MRR in a quarter.

When things work, the first question you should ask yourself is: Can you do more of it?

In our case, I believe we can do more& and better!

Thus, we started an internal content challenge with the following prizes:
>G2,500¬
>H1,500¬
>I1,000¬

The rule: whoever has the most posts above 20 likes wins.

And as a bonus, every team member who posts 20+ times during the quarter gets 500¬.

And to ensure everyone is publishing quality pieces, 
were doing a monthly LinkedIn training session&

In which we share best practices.

Last time, we mentioned:

1ã Recording yourself during your work

For example, if youre cold calling or closing deals. Try having a nice setup (itll look better in sales calls, too) and record your calls. 

At times, you might catch yourself saying something super smart& >
which you can cut later on and publish on LinkedIn.

(Its also pretty badass if youre live closing a huge deal)


2ã Commenting as much as possible

Last year, I read an experiment in which someone tried:

- Commenting only for a week
- Posting only for a week
- Posting + Commenting

Guess which week they got the most profile views?

(Spoiler: when they did both)

Whats interesting, however, is that they got more people looking at their profile when they just commented than when they just posted.

The fastest creators on LinkedIn are commenting a lot.


3ã Taking some time creating great visuals

A great visual on a text-only post can go as far as 3Xing your post reach.

People seem to love schemas, carousels or just aesthetically pleasing images.

Get a great designer like Clara Güiraldes and have her create designs for your whole team. 


4ã Using platforms such as Kleo/Taplio for content ideation

These platforms help you find posts that went viral. 
Its the fastest shortcut to know what a good post looks like. 

Study their hooks (hint: numbers in the hooks tend to do well)
& their CTAs (hint: call-to-conversation CTAs help with overall engagement).

P.S: I spent an hour training my team on LinkedIn posting last Wednesday. This includes many secrets I didnt want to share publicly.

4ã The 'coolest' tech I'm *completely* bullish on

’ Vector

It does on-site visitor identification, but its flagship product is off-site identification.

In short, they're able to know who's researching your keywords and identify them.

For us, it could mean knowing who's looking for ""AI Sales tools"" 
(Precisely the kind of people we'd want to be talking with!)


’ Octave

Probably the first AI product that went hard on cracking outbound messaging.

It helps you uncover your ICP's priorities and pain points and draft relevant messages based on that information.


’ Unify

An end-to-end solution for automated outbound, based on triggers and intent signals.
One of the closest platforms to being a true all-in-one solution.


’ Artisan

An AI SDR.. that actually writes good emails! 

I've been sceptical about AI SDRs for the longest time, but both the underlying technology (AI) and these products are improving.

Most don't like to hear this, but the future of sales involves robots >

urn:li:ugcPost:7251989214169374720,"How to stand out with LinkedIn DMs

(Based on 150+ DMs I got in the last 7 days)


BACKGROUND:

I sent 1M+ outbound messages for ColdIQ.

But I now spend more time responding than running campaigns.

Im the CEO of a 20-person company.

So, imagine how much outreach 100+ people CXOs get.

That said, I look at my inbox.
And I respond to messages.

Heres how I decide to reply
And how I adapted my outreach because of it:



L Cold calls

I never answer calls. But thats just me. Calls are efficient. 

We don't provide it as a service (yet)
But we enrich mobile data with FullEnrich for many of our clients. 

Dujam Dunato also calls hot leads based on some combination of intent signals.

(He booked 9 meetings last week)



L Generic messages

Its not that I dont want to answer. Its just that if youre sending a copy/pasted template to everyone, youre likely off the mark.

E.g: Getting contacted about offers for our SaaS (which we are not).



L Outreach asking for time on the 1st touchpoint

I try to minimise the # of meetings I have every week.

If the first thing you do is ask me for 30 min of my time, Ill find a way out.



= Videos

I dont always reply, but I cant help myself from watching. 
Videos are typically good at grabbing peoples attention. 

Sendspark can help with that.



= Voice notes

I cant help myself from listening. 
If you send me a voice note, Ill listen.

lemlist lets you send lots of these.



 Relevant messages asking to be referred

If you send some outreach based on a current ColdIQ initiative, Ill pay attention.

If you notice that someone else owns the initiative& Ill happily refer you.

Note: You can facilitate this process.

Combining intent signals with finding a colleague in a relevant department can be done inside Clay.
You can also stack signals for each of your prospects via Common Room



 Relevant messages offering a free resource

If your message is relevant, Ill still want to evaluate your offering in greater detail before committing to a 30-min meeting.

I got lots of DMs from sellers suggesting they can send a follow-up video, and I check these out more often than not.



 Relevant messages offering *free* work

I've gotten DMs offering to re-write my landing page or edit videos I made.
Some even went as far as sending some samples of already-made work.

If you can do something thats not too time-consuming but provides value& dont hesitate!

We ran campaigns where we offered free custom lead lists to our prospects... 
and these crushed every time!



 Messages from important people

This is unfair.

But whenever I receive a message from a VC, a CXO at a large company or a well-known Founder or Thought Leader&

I always end up replying.

Building your brand has a huge impact on conversions.
(The more followers I gain, the higher my response rate is)


That's it!

P.S: Have you ever received a cold outbound message so good... that it was impossible to ignore?

Let me know what it was!",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7251989214169374720,,8 months ago,michel-lieben,ACoAABz69VcBRJaBY9RjHepUO_eOzgx7ou7WMl8,Michel,Lieben,Founder / CEO @ ColdIQ | Scale Outbound with AI & Tech =I coldiq.com,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQGTSYwr7t9lGQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1711976708629?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=wYLrjp8wXzgE4Exk6p7UMhoo9tbW2kdWYSddyHkKvX0,1.0,,,,,True,Yes,No,Yes
urn:li:activity:7251610712089800706,"Best performing intent signals for ColdIQ's outbound campaigns:

(Common Rooms tracks > 25 of these)


1ã Website Visitor Identification

One of our favourites. 
Works best if you get lots of website visits.


The idea is simple:
’ Someone visits your site.
’ CommonRoom (or else) identifies the person.
’ You use this information with additional research/qualification to reach your prospects.


Typically, you want to triangulate information around:
- the page they visited
- how you can help
- whats going on in their company at the moment.


2ã Job changes

There are 2 main ways we use this signal:


A. Someone using your product at a previous company joins a new one.

Here, its mostly about re-starting the conversation with them:


Brian LaManna published a great template for this use case a few weeks ago:

Hi {{first_name}},

I saw that you recently joined {account name} coming from a Gong customer, {{! insert last company}} - congrats on your new role as {{title}}!

Given that, you're no stranger to Gong and I'll spare you the pitch.

As I'm sure you'll agree, Gong could help: [benefit 1], [benefit 2], [benefit 3]

Worth a chat? No expectations beyond sharing a few ideas and seeing where it goes.

Brian

P.S. [fill in something personal from LI profile]


B. Someone (a new decision maker) joined less than 3 months ago.

Here we typically start by congratulating them on their new role. Then we ask questions about potential pain points or issues in the department they now own.



3ã Job openings

This has been used a lot, but it is still effective if you make an effort that goes beyond: I see youre hiring SDRs. Do you want to use an outsourced SDR agency?

The key to this signal is to look at the job description for the opening. 

Most precisely, the responsibilities and priorities of the new hire.

Companies typically dont decide to open new jobs without proper consideration.

Thus, instead of positioning your product or service as a replacement for the new person, youre better off positioning it as an enhancement for what the person will do.



4ã News announcement

This could mean mergers, acquisitions, new product launches & more.

Each event precedes periods of change - which present opportunities for you to help.

For example, M&As typically lead to redundancies in some roles, the need for training to adapt to new tools/systems& changes in leadership, etc.

For product launches, it could signal the need for more engineering talent or more budget allocated to marketing, etc&

-----

We use a lot more than these 4 depending on clients' products & requirements.

There are no one-size-fits-all signals.

My best advice is to look at all potential signals you could leverage.
And see how they are relevant to your product.

Common Room has a great ""Signal Spectrum Map"" resource for that.
(Let me know if you want it... and I'll share it!)

urn:li:ugcPost:7249064853951102978,"Hot take: AI SDRs will crush the average SDR

(Within the next 4 years)

Theres an echo chamber on LinkedIn

Where everyone comforts each others opinion about how human relationships matter more than anything else.

And I agree with that.

But that doesnt take away from the fact that many tasks can be automated - and will be taken over by robots.

Most still underestimate how fast AI models are advancing.

’ Today, they write and debug code, and beat the majority of high schoolers at any given test.

urn:li:ugcPost:7247673309947953153,"How often should you promote your website on LinkedIn?

Its no surprise that most social platforms want you to stay ON the platform.

The reason is pretty simple:
’ The more time you spend browsing your feed&
’ The more ads they can show you&
’ The more money they make.

Thus if youre often adding external links to your publications&

Youre missing out on many people being shown your posts.

That said, if youre selling high-ticket B2B products, you need people to land on your site.


Heres what I recommend:

’ Avoid external links on most publications.
(LinkedIn will reward you by sharing your posts a lot)

’ Add website links to your profile and your featured section.

’ Once in a while, add a link without the https://

(Within 3 weeks of ramping up new mailboxes)


1ã Create 20 new domains (e.g: growwithcoldiq[.]com) that forward to your main one (ColdIQ.com)

To spread our bets, we purchase them on Cloudfare, Squarespace, GoDaddy & domains[.]com 

Most important part is to have only 1 tenant per domain. 
³ Every domain is set up under a separate workspace, so no inbox is linked to another.

’ You can also buy domains through Instantly AI


2ã Set up 2 mailboxes per domain (= 40 in total)

(Best practice is to do a 50:50 split between Outlook & Google Suite )

For each domain, you can setup 2 mailboxes... for example:

- michel@coldiqflows[.]com
- alex@coldiqflows[.]com

One important detail is to add a public profile picture to each mailbox.

(95%+ emails I get dont include this because it requires a manual step to set up)

’ Instantly's ""Done-For-You Email Setup"" can create G-Suite mailboxes for you.


3ã Get Instantly.ai to run your email outreach and warm up your domains.

They have features such as:

- Provider Matching (which matches your leads email provider with your mailbox provider)
- Auto-optimize A/Z Testing (which automatically picks the best-performing email variants)
- Random sending patterns
- Text-only Emails

... they're made to land your emails in the main inbox.


4ã Send under 25 emails per mailbox per day.

To avoid spam, gradually increase the sending volume and keep it below 25 emails daily.

If you wish to scale the volume, adding new mailboxes rather than sending more per mailbox is best.


5ã Remove open tracking

Open tracking has stopped being reliable for some time.

Thus, the best practice is to disable the tracking and focus on 'better' metrics like:
- how many positive replies you get.
- how many meetings you book.

urn:li:activity:7244013809936269317,"I bootstrapped ColdIQ from 0 to $2.5M+ in ARR in 19 months.

Heres what Id do if I had to do it all over again:


1ã Start creating content, ASAP

Ironic since I run an outbound agency. But I promise every person you contact whos considering doing business with you& will check you out.

Youre not Coca-Cola (yet!), and I found that the fastest way to build trust is to share high-quality thoughts online. 

Id start with, at least, 3x per week for 3 months. Without letting yourself slip. 

Content is a long-term game.

In the beginning, consistency matters more than creating the best possible post every time.

Quantity breeds quality. 

Youll know what a great post looks like once you hit the publish button 50 times.

(PS: Check that your audience is on LinkedIn first)


2ã Connect with my ICP on LinkedIn

In the beginning, your content will likely be exposed to very few people.

Thus, you need to see it as a trust mechanism as opposed to a lead generation mechanism.

Content will attract inbound leads. 

Just not from day 1.

What itll do, however, is improve your conversion rates when you reach out to people.

Whenever you send a connection request, a DM, or drop a comment under someones post& they might check out.

If they see 20+ pieces of your content on your topic of expertise, theyll trust you know a thing or 2.

(PS: You can use lemlist or HeyReach for connection requests)


3ã Leverage signals to decide when to reach out

As you ramp up your lead generation activities (cold emails, LinkedIn DMs, social posts, comments), you increase your exposure to potential clients.

Theyll start interacting in various waysfor example, by:

A. Visiting your LinkedIn profile
³ Use Sales Navigator & Prospeo to extract your profile viewers' contact information.

B. Liking or commenting on your posts
³ Use Common Room to extract engagers & have a 360° overview of all the ways prospects interacted with you.

C. Visit your website
³ Use a lead magnet to capture email addresses & a tool such as RB2B to identify your website visitors.

For all the above instances, you can reach out in a non-pushy way with a message such as

Hey- looks like you were {looking at my profile}.
Curious if something caught your interest?
Im available if you have any questions.
Cheers

The more conversations you have ’ the more chances you have to sell.

 Do all the above long enough. Improve a little bit every day. And Ill promise youll start closing clients.

urn:li:activity:7242517481767018498,"Here's why your AI-personalized emails suck:

You don't have enough context on your prospects.


I recently started playing around with Common Room

And Im completely bullish on the tool.

Heres why:

They recently launched an AI co-pilot (Roomie AI) to help personalize messaging.

What makes them different is that they have much more context than any other platform.

Think about most AI-personalized plays for a second:

- Its usually a quick visit to a LinkedIn profile or a website.
- Based on that, AI sellers prompt the models to find an interesting angle from which to base their personalization.

Most spend too much time getting the prompt right.
But in my opinion, the magic lies in how much context you have on each prospect.

Common Room tracks & layer buying signals such as:
- recent news
- job changes
- website visits
- social engagement
- participation in community

and over 50+ signals.
(see below)

Thats the level of context it has for each prospect.


Now imagine this. Your prospect:
- visited your website
- is hiring across their team
- engaged on your CEOs latest post (about a new feature drop)
- changed role recently (& was using your product at a previous role)


Not only does their platform pick up all these signals, but you can prompt it to write something such as:

Hey {{first_name}},

Looks like youve gotten the news about our {{feature}} launch. 

Since youve used {{your product}} at {{their previous organization}} I assume youre familiar already, but I thought you might enjoy seeing it in action.

Id be more than happy to walk you through it.

Let me know how that sounds.

Cheers,


The output would change based on the context you have.

But, once again, by layering signals on top of each other&

Youre giving AI a lot of context to craft a relevant message.

We find much better results by leveraging several data sources.

One reason is that providers have vastly different coverage across regions.

Heres *all* you need to build a great sales stack:


1ã An accurate B2B database

Every successful outbound campaign starts with the right data.

Here are a few platforms Id consider:

- LinkedIn Sales Navigator: The O.G of B2B data. Professionals keep their data up to date to find opportunities, whether its finding jobs or clients.
- Ocean.io: A great database to find hard-to-find niche data. Plus, their lookalike features make it easy to target companies similar to your existing clients.
- Telescope: A ChatGPT-like experience to find data paired with a platform that learns from your search. Why use filters when you can simply tell the software what youre looking for.


2ã Clean data enrichment platforms

Finding valid email addresses & phone numbers is the most effective way to avoid wasting your reps time.

Here are a few platforms were using every day for our clients:

- Prospeo: Our go-to to extract email addresses from LinkedIn
- FullEnrich: The best waterfall solution for emails & phone numbers.
- LeadMagic: Great for data enrichment and the best at validating emails.

And, of course, Clay. Which lets you enrich leads within their platform AND orchestrate complex workflows.


3ã A cold outreach platform (with features to avoid SPAM)

ColdIQs cold email campaigns are powered by Instantly.ai.

When I want to reach prospects across several channels, I use lemlist.

Other great alternatives that we use for clients include:
Smartlead (for email outreach)
HeyReach (for Linkedin outreach)


4ã Platforms that help with lead management

Once your top-of-funnel is handled, youll need help handling your lead flow.

At ColdIQ we use: 

- Default to automatically qualify & route leads to the right person.
- HubSpot as our CRM solution, to have an overview of our existing pipeline.
- Attention to record, transcribe & summarize our sales calls. Plus, gather insights around the most frequent objections we encountered.
- Common Room to layer signals on our prospects & re-activate leads once the timing is right.


5ã Other *fancy* but effective sales technology

urn:li:activity:7238948479853637632,"Since joining ColdIQ, Fivos Aresti has closed $1.3M in ARR. 

This earned him the right to be my personal favourite =

But most importantly, I asked him what he had done to close all these deals successfully.

Here are his main takeaways: 


1ã Being (& staying!) an expert at cold outbound

When Fivos first joined, he did like every other joiner and took on a few clients. He did a great job with these.

As he transitioned out to sales, he insisted on keeping at least two clients at all times.

This means hes selling a service he knows the ins and outs of. And hes able to sell consultatively since hes giving recommendations around outbound& which he practices every single day.


2ã Matching buyers urgency during closing

Hes never pushing to close a deal. If its not the right time, he wont push. This is the opposite of the *aggressive* type of seller you see on TV shows. 

He simply gives recommendations for the next steps, as a doctor would.


3ã Always be learning

Hes constantly: 
- Reading new books on sales. 
- Getting personal coaching from top sales experts such as =i<û
<ë Krysten Conner. 
- And learning through courses from top voices such as Christian Krause & Brian LaManna.


4ã Multi-single threading to build champions

He manually writes down questions that each participant has had in his calls. After the calls, he sends a 1-1 email to each, answering their question. 

He grabs the opportunity to provide even more value - by sending a nicely laid-out document or a short video.


5ã Leveraging technology

Like every great ColdIQ team member - Fivos leverages technology to move faster.

Typically,
- He uses Attention to record his meetings and take notes. 
- Hell use Circleback to update deals in the CRM automatically.
- He uses HubSpot to log centralised info around all his deal
- He uses Qwilr to send out nice proposals.

Our main tactic?

A mix of waterfall personalization & content-based CTA =G

’ By content-based CTA, I simply mean offering to send a relevant piece of content instead of asking straight for a meeting.

’ As for waterfall personalization& the idea is that you look for a first data point. If you cant find it, you look for a second one. And so on:

In more detail:
Lets say youve got a list of *relevant* leads - and want to personalise your messages further&

But you cant find a single personalization point that works for each prospect.


Heres a workaround you can build inside Clay:


1ã You can check if your prospects have posted on LinkedIn in the last 2 weeks

If they have, you create a custom prompt that will craft an icebreaker relating to the content of your prospects post.


2ã If they havent posted, you can check if they hired in their department last quarter.

If so, you can mention the new hires name to congratulate your prospect (the team leader) on the growth!


3ã If they didnt post, nor did they hire, you can check out how long they worked at the company and write a custom line for any major milestone (e.g: 1 year in, anniversaries)


4ã And if even #3 fails to provide an interesting data point, we personalize on the fact that they lead a niche business (it has to be true - which we made sure as we built our lists)

Not only do I want that& its my priority for the rest of the year.
And if youre a B2B company whose audience is on the platform& I believe it should be your priority as well.

Last quarter, we generated 4,104,960+ impressions which led to 356 meetings& leading to $80k+ in closed monthly recurring revenue.

Now, many have bought on the idea that Founder-Brand is the future of B2B marketing.
Which I actually agree with.

I mean& just have a look at what Adam Robinson has been doing with RB2B

But what happens when Adam gets sick or runs out of ideas to post?
What happens when you go on a vacation?

Im assuming this is why other team members such as Santosh, Pete & Robb are frequently posting.

I look up to Adams when it comes to the quality of the publications I wish to post on the platform&

But when it comes to LinkedIn strategy& my goal is simple: 
’ I want to replicate lemlists playbook:

Guillaume Moubeche is creating a viral publication every other day of the week.

(And from what Ive heard, his impressions alone surpass our whole team combined)

But I believe the real magic is that hes got Kévin (~77k followers), Lucas (56k), Roxana (48k), Tal (32k), Charles (17k) & others actively posting as well!

Safe to say that if G gets banned from LinkedIn& they should be alright =

Guess who I could count on?

which meant we kept on getting a healthy inbound flow.


Im now back to push the numbers up =

Heres a typical list building workflow:
³ [1] LinkedIn Sales Navigator search = 1400 contacts.
³ [2] Extracting email addresses = 800 emails found.
³ [3] Validate found emails = 550 valid emails.

’ 1400 - 550 = 850 wasted opportunities.


Here's how we brought them back =G


1ã We switched to better email finding technology:

We use Prospeo to find and validate over 100,000 emails monthly.

The tool has been reliably enriching email addresses for ColdIQ for a year now.


2ã We use waterfall enrichment to find the remaining ones:

FullEnrich aggregates > 15 premium providers to lookup emails and phone numbers. 

If one solution doesnt find the email, another one will. This can improve your email finding rate from 50% to 85%.

(See Slide 4 in the carousel)


3ã We validate catch-all emails (= emails that are unverifiable) 

A proportion of found emails cannot be validated.

It's typically best not to reach out to these email addresses. 
(It will increase your bounce rate, which means ’ more chances of the rest of your emails to land in spam)

Platforms such as Scrubby | Complete email validation & BounceBan (Verify risky emails without sending messages) can validate up to ~80% of these unverifiable emails.

urn:li:activity:7227618603041275904,"AI BDRs vs Custom solutions requiring 'technical' sellers

How about& something in the middle?

AI BDRs came with lots of promise.
Your prospecting, on autopilot&

Without any human in the loop.

The issue?
To this day, you cant blindly trust the output for most of these solutions.

Just look at your LinkedIn feed. Every day youll see someone making fun of an AI-generated email they received.

On the other hand, flexible solutions such as Clay let you build nearly any campaigns you want to run.

The issue?
It requires a skilled person that knows how to navigate the tool.

(I can tell you for having trained 60+ people on the tool& the learning curve is steep)

Heres where I find platforms such as Unify very interesting:
- You have the flexibility of building complex workflows
- With pre-made plays/templates you can run without needing a technical person.

For example:
A play we like a lot at ColdIQ is reaching out to companies looking at G2 listings.
It can be your listing& or your competitors.

Nailing a campaign based on such a signal is tedious with flexible solutions&
While AI BDRs wouldnt even consider this play.

With Unify though, youre a few steps away from a ready-made campaign.

You simply need to:
’ Integrate the platform with your G2 API Key
’ Segment audiences within the platform by creating filters for your pages of interest (e.g: are you most interested in prospects visiting your page, your competitor page or an industry page?)
’ Decide on a persona (e.g: Sales Leaders) & max. number of people to reach per company.
’ Enroll them into an engagement cadence.

Once thats set up  the campaign runs 100% on autopilot...

And leads keep being added and reached out to, in a highly contextual way.

urn:li:ugcPost:7226205868978040832,"If youre running an agency

Youre likely making the same claims your competition makes.

Its one of the most commoditised business model to exist.

On one hand, theres lot of money to be made.
On the other hand, the barrier to entry is extremely low.

Many agencies try to fight on claims.

’ Ill get you 20+ meetings per month

And the next one try to outclaims the previous& (theyll get you 30 meetings =	)

It ends up being this constant escalation of who can promise the most&
With the performance offers, the guarantees and so on.

Pretty soon, you realise you cant grow your service business by promising the moon.

So you need to find a way to differentiate.

One thing I advise doing:
Try to own a term within your service line.

Outbound Sales is what you do&
But AI prompting, copywriting, sales technology can be your differentiation point.

Let me explain in more details:

Naval Ravitkant has this quote that reads: Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.

When I went full time on ColdIQ, 19 months ago&

It wouldve been weird of me to say Im the best outbound agency in the world.

So instead of doing that, I picked a component of outbound sales and made it my own:
’ Sales Technology.

Now, was I running the best outbound agency in the world?
Probably not.

Was I running the most technology advanced outbound agency?
Perhaps. At least it looked like so.

This was redefining what I was doing

The benefit of this? 
It got us much more attention than the average outbound agency gets.

You know how everybody knows the name of the #1 sprinter in the world, but nobody knows whos 2nd best?

When you make such a strategic positioning choice&
Some people will hate on you, or rather your views around your craft.

YoU DoNt NeEd ThAt MuCh TeCh

Its alright. Its polarising. Not everyone likes tech.

But others LOVE tech.
And this is where it gets interesting.

B2B services are typically high-ticket.
If 97% of the world hates your worldview, but the remaining 3% love it and want to invest some money in you&

Youve got more than enough to run a successful business.

So if you need to make the choice between appealing to everyone vs. being polarising&

You should pick the latter every time.
Especially if youre competing in a commoditised space such as the agency space.

And even more so, when just having a few clients is sufficient to generate decent revenue.


P.S: What are your thoughts on that? I don't talk about 'agency positionning' very often - but this has been a huge reason for our 'fast' growth.

I dont know whats most impressive to me...

The pace at which theyre shipping features or 
how in tune they are with the market =G


QUICK RECAP:

1ã Over a month ago, they launched their done-for-you email infrastructure.

Many teams have been struggling with SPAM, and the quickest fix to that is to create new domains & mailboxes.

Heres the issue: 
’ Setting up domains & mailboxes is the most annoying thing to do in the world.

So you either outsource it or build automations that make it bearable.

Now, you can simply use their setup and have it done in no time.


2ã A couple of weeks ago, they added visitor identification to their platform.

Inbound-Led Outbound or Allbound has been all the rage lately. 
An increasing number of GTM teams figured they'd get better results by reaching out to folks already familiar with them.

There are a few ways to do that: 
- Looking at who viewed your profile
- Looking at who engaged with your posts
- Looking at who signed up for your newsletter

AND looking at who was on your website.


It didnt take long before Instantly realised the timing was right and shipped the feature. 

You can now identify your website visitors within their platform.


3ã This week, they added catch-all verification.

If youve been finding & verifying emails for a long time... 

You already know that youre losing a large number of reachable contacts because of these so-called unverifiable email addresses.

With these, you had 2 options:
- Reaching out anyways (and risking your email reputation by sending emails to addresses that dont exist).
- Not reaching out at all (and losing out on prospects that couldve converted to deals).

No need to pick anymore. 
Theres a third solution, which is to - somehow - verify these catch-all emails& 

And Instantly just do that for you now.

What tools get if you have a 'lower' budget:


1ã You'll need to grab a few secondary mailboxes to avoid blacklisting your main one.

This means:
- purchasing domains through Namecheap or Instantly (ai.coldiq.com/instantly)
- creating mailboxes (preferably Google Suite & Office 365)

Domains = ~$50 per year (for 4 domains)
Mailboxes = ~$24/mo.

(The easiest would be to do it all within Instantly's done-for-you setup)


2ã You'll need a platform to search & segment prospects from:

There are several options, but you can't go wrong with LinkedIn Sales Navigator.

If you go for an alternative, it's likely they got their data from there anyway!

Sales Navigator (Core) Subscription = $99/mo


3ã You'll need a tool to find your prospects' email addresses:

Prospeo (go.coldiq.com/prospeo) lets you extract email addresses straight from a LinkedIn search.

FullEnrich (ai.coldiq.com/fullenrich) does the same but also has phone numbers and aggregates several providers.


At ColdIQ, we typically use Prospeo to find emails and use FullEnrich for the email we couldn't find (since it aggregates several providers)

Prospeo = $39/mo to find 1,000 verified email addresses.
FullEnrich = $55/mo to find 1,000 verified email addresses.


4ã Finally, you'll need a cold emailing platform to send from:

Instantly's $37/mo plan lets you send 5,000 monthly emails.
Plus, it includes email warm-up, automated outreach & follow-ups.


In total, you're looking at =G 

Domains (~$50 one time) + Inboxes (~25/mo) + Sales Navigator ($99/mo)  + Instantly ($37/mo) + Prospeo ($39/mo) or FullEnrich ($55/mo)

And had people come from all over Europe: <ë<÷ Arnaud & Jérémy, <ó<ñ Michaël, <ì<ç Ryane&  + <ê<ø Oriol, Alan, Pierre, Caspar...

I introduced the event by telling the story of how I discovered Clay&
and the moment I knew it was gonna change the outbound game forever. 

Then Alex, Dan, Fivos & Stefan gave great talks about how & why use Clay.


However, what I didnt talk about was the huge part Clay played in getting us to $2M+ in ARR:

One year and a half ago, Clay wasnt talked about as much.
Very few people were making content showcasing its abilities.

As soon as I started playing around with it, I knew it was a giant in the making.

I sent a message to Varun, asking (begging) him to give me a referral link,
because I figured it was a no-brainer platform to promote.

$120,000+ later in tracked affiliate revenue generated for Clay&
(which doesnt account for the free promo we never got attribution for)

I can confidently say that Clay made us much more revenue than we made them:

’ Obviously, we wouldnt be able to run our agency as efficiently without the tool.

Takeaway #1: Their tech will help your sales team be much more efficient.


’ But also, showcasing workflows and use-cases of Clay probably generated 500+ meetings for our agency.

Takeaway #2: Show the world what you can do with the tool. The workflow you show could be exactly what a business owner has been attempting to build.


’ Better yet& I cant count the number of deals we closed by building Clay tables live in front of prospects - creating workflows they didnt know were possible to build.

urn:li:ugcPost:7222561057364480000,"Are your emails landing in spam?

Here's what to do to prevent that from happening ever again:


1ã Build an email infrastructure with secondary domains and mailboxes:

Instantly.ai has a done-for-you cold email set-up that helps with that.

Alternatively, you can set this up yourself by purchasing domains on Namecheap, and getting a mix of Outlook & Google mailboxes.


2ã Warm-up your mailboxes and progressively increase daily sends:

Platforms such as lemlist, Instantly & MailReach can help you improve your domain reputation through their warm-up features.

If you dont want to warm up your domains  start with a very low volume of sends and increase it slowly and progressively.


3ã Clean your contact lists

Emails that bounce are the biggest tell that youre doing cold outreach. 

Jesse Ouellette explained it best: Imagine youre sending emails to someone you know& what are the odds you get their email address wrong? 

Very low, right? Thats how Google knows.

’ Thus, make sure to use reputable tools to find and validate emails (e.g: LeadMagic, FullEnrich or Prospeo)


4ã Optimise your email copy for deliverability

That is:
- As few spam words as possible (Folderly & Mailmeteor have a free tool to check that)
- Plain text writing without HTML
- As few links as possible
- No open rate tracking
- Spintax variation


5ã Match your email service provider to the one of your prospects

Use a Google mailbox to send to another Google mailbox.
Use an Outlook mailbox to send to another Outlook mailbox.

Instantly & Smartlead have a feature that handles this.


6ã Re-read your emails and ask yourself& would I like to receive this in MY inbox?

At the end of the day, every optimisation wont matter if you dont send emails worth reading.

Remember, youre sending an unsolicited email to someone who likely receives too many.

Most outreach is impersonal, generic junk that doesnt focus on the recipient.


If you provide great value, you can break all the rules above& and youll do just fine.

Which tools should you get? =G


1ã Reliable data sources

’ LinkedIn is the king of B2B data. Many software get their data from there platform. 

’ Telescope has a novel approach to list building: you search prospects by typing what youre looking for (ChatGPT style).

They suggest relevant accounts to target, which you approve/decline. Their algorithm learns whos a great fit for you.

’ Ocean's lookalike search is another cool option: input target companies, and its algorithm finds the most similar ones.


2ã Data enrichment solutions

’ Prospeo (ai.coldiq.com/prospeo) extracts contacts from LinkedIn and finds their email addresses.

’ LeadMagic is an enrichment solution thatll get you valid emails and phone numbers.

’ Solutions such as FullEnrich (ai.coldiq.com/fullenrich) & Clay (ai.coldiq.com/clay) aggregate data sources through their waterfall enrichment to find phone numbers and email addresses.


3ã Intent signal solutions

’ RB2B (ai.coldiq.com/rb2b) de-anonymizes your website visitors and provides their LinkedIn URLs & email addresses. There are many ways to leverage this for prospecting.

’ Unify (ai.coldiq.com/unify)s platform combines several signals, such as website visitors & champion tracking.

’ Clay (ai.coldiq.com/clay) also has a broad range of signals (company news, hiring events, fundraising events&) in their platform.


4ã Deliverability platforms

- lemlist (ai.coldiq.com/lemlist) has the most user-friendly, fast & bug-free platform Ive used to date.

’ For multichannel outreach: lemlist (ai.coldiq.com/lemlist) lets you create sequences that engage leads via email, LinkedIn, the phone & sends voice notes.


6ã Platforms that help close deals

’ Hubspot is the gold standard of CRMs.For social selling, you should try Breakcold as your CRM.

Getting from 0 ’ 1 was the hardest thing I ever had to do. 
And I believe the biggest element to achieving this is the ability to thrive under chaos.

Youre doing it all& which means nothing gets properly done.
Youre selling, delivering a service/product, and marketing& at the same time.

Your bank account is close to $0, and thats when a client decides they dont want to pay you.

Everything is a mess, and you have to be ok with it.

Because the key to getting out of it is to add to the mess&
by selling, delivering & marketing even more.


At some point, you realise the mess you started has turned into an actual business.

And right when you started to thrive under the chaos&
You realise that if you want to scale your business& 

You now have to create processes and put things in order.
The opposite of what you had done thus far... because everyone actually hates chaos.

Its now a completely different game. 

While 0 ’ 1 was about survival, grit, skill & vision.
1 ’ 10 is about systems, hiring, team and training.

Typically, people who are great at 0 ’ 1 suck at the 1 ’ 10&

1ã Let AI recommend best fit prospects/accounts 

Platforms such as Telescope let you swipe right or left on your target prospects (Tinder style), and their algorithm learns who you want to target.

After enough swiping, they're able to recommend some very similar prospects to the one you're after.


2ã Let AI source prospects' information & data points

AI agents such as Claygent perform research across large lists of targets to find precise data points you're looking for. 

They'll browse the web on your behalf, visit several pages, and get you the required information in a matter of seconds.


3ã Let AI record your meetings and take notes

Note-taking platforms such as Attention will join calls with you and record, transcribe, and summarize what is discussed during the meetings.

They can also sync with your CRM and help you draft follow-ups based on the conversations.


4ã Let AI improve your sales copy

Platforms such as Twain will provide suggestions in real time to improve your writing. They coach you by explaining why their suggestions make for a better alternative than your initial writing.


5ã Let AI improve your domain reputation

Platforms such as Instantly.ai simulate interactions between your mailbox and others. Whenever emails land in spam, they dynamically remove them and mark them as safe.

Plus, you can also let AI...
6ã find similar accounts to your ideal target companies (Ocean.io)

(Within 2 to 3 weeks of ramp-up)


1ã Create 10 new domains (e.g: coldiqflows.com) that forward to your main one (coldiq.com).

We use Namecheap to purchase them. You can also do so within Instantly (ai.coldiq.com/instantly)


2ã Set up 20 mailboxes on top of these domains 

(Ideally, a 50:50 split between Outlook and Google Suite).

Instantly's ""Done-For-You Email Setup"" can take care of the G-Suite mailboxes, so you don't have to.

For each domain, you can setup 2 mailboxes... for example:
- michel@coldiqflows.com
- alex@coldiqflows.com

Instantly has a feature called ""Provider Matching"", which ""matches your lead's email provider with your mailbox provider"". This usually boosts deliverability.


3ã Get Instantly to run your email outreach and warm up your domains.

They include features such as:
- Auto-optimize A/Z Testing (which automatically picks the best performing email variants)
- Random sending patterns
- Text-only Emails

... they're made to land your emails in the main inbox.


4ã Keep sending limits below < 30 emails per inbox per day.

If you want to stay out of spam, gradually increase sending volume and stay below 30 emails per day. 

If you wish to scale the volume, it is best to add new mailboxes rather than sending more per mailbox.


5ã Remove open tracking

You might want to leave open rate tracking, in the beginning, to 'ensure' there aren't any major issues with your outreach campaigns. 

But you should know that the metric isn't 100% reliable. 

Thus, as soon as possible, disable the tracking and focus on 'more' important metrics such as:
- # of positive replies
- # of booked meetings

than running campaigns.

Yesterday, I spent 2 hours cleaning my inbox, which had 150+ unread DMs

So, imagine the amount of outreach CXOs at 100+ people companies get.

That said, I AM looking at my inbox. 
And I AM responding to messages.

Heres how I decide to reply or not& and how I adapted my outreach because of it:

(Note: I wanted to write this post. Because every time I read such posts, it is written by marketers/engineers or non-sales leaders who think that receiving lots of outreach qualified to tell sellers how to do their jobs)


L Cold calls

I never answer calls from strangers. But thats just me. Calls are efficient. Were not providing the service, but were enriching mobile data for many of our clients. The ones who do calls book a good number of meetings.


L Generic messages

Its not that I dont want to answer. Its just that if youre sending a copy/pasted template to everyone, youre likely off the mark. 

E.g: Getting contacted about offers for our SaaS (which we are not).


L Outreach asking for time on the 1st touchpoint

I try to minimise the # of meetings I have every week. If the first thing you do is ask me for 30 min of my time, I'll find a way out.


= Videos

I dont always reply, but I cant help myself from watching. Videos are typically good at grabbing peoples attention. Sendspark can help with that.


= Voice notes

I cant help myself from listening to voice notes. If you send me one, I'll listen. (lemlist has a feature that automates these)


 Relevant messages asking to be referred

If you send some outreach based on a current ColdIQ initiative, Ill pay attention. 

If you notice that someone else owns the initiative& Ill happily refer you.

Note: You can automate this process. Combining intent signals with finding a colleague in a relevant department can be done inside Clay.


 Relevant messages offering a free resource

If your message is relevant, Ill still want to evaluate your offering in greater detail before committing to a 30-min meeting.

I got lots of DMs from sellers suggesting they can send a follow-up video, and I frequently check these out.


 Relevant messages offering *free* work

Ive gotten DMs offering to re-write my landing page or edit videos I made. Some even went as far as sending some samples of already-made work.

If you can do something thats not too time-consuming but provides value& dont hesitate! 

We ran campaigns where we offered free lead lists to our prospects, and these crushed every time.


 Messages from important people

This is unfair. But whenever I receive a message from a VC, a CXO at a large company or a ""well-known founder or thought leader& I always end up replying. 

Building your brand has a huge impact on conversions.

urn:li:activity:7214657834515378176,"There are over > 850 AI Sales Tools on ColdIQs website.

Here are 5 types of platforms you should add to your sales stack:


1ã A platform that helps you to research prospects & accounts.

Sending relevant outreach is *arguably* the biggest lever to pull to improve your campaigns.

This typically stems from properly researching the companies & prospects youre planning to reach out to.

But good research is time-consuming, and this is where AI agents such as Claygent, Relevance AI or Bardeen can save you lots of time.


2ã A platform that recommends accounts to target.

Going after similar companies to your best clients can be a great starting point for your outreach campaigns.

But its often difficult to find these companies using standard filters from databases such as LinkedIn Sales Navigator or Apollo.

In these instances, a recommender platform such as Telescope or a lookalike platform like Ocean.io can help you find similar great-fit companies, thanks to their trained algorithms.


3ã A platform that helps you land in your prospects inbox.

With Google/Outlook cracking down on cold emails& getting your messages delivered is becoming the #1 bottleneck for many outbound teams.

Platforms such as Instantly.ai, lemlist & Smartlead have built-in email deliverability features thatll help keep you out of spam.


4ã A platform that takes notes on your behalf in sales calls.

For sellers who have many daily conversations, its almost impossible to keep track of all essential information.

Note-taking platforms such as Attention, tl;dv - AI Meeting Assistant & Piper help you by transcribing & recording calls, and also draft your follow-ups.


5ã A platform that help you send personalized messages at scale.

Platforms such as Unify will leverage intent signals to find companies to target and engage them 1:1 based on these signals. 

Alternatively, video platforms such as Sendspark help you send 100s of AI-personalised videos by just recording one.


6ã A platform that helps you write better messages.

When it comes to matters as subjective as copy, it can be tricky to know where to start improving the quality of your written messages.

AI copywriting coaches such as Twain provide real-time recommendations, suggestions, and explanations for writing more effectively.

P.S: Interestingly, we noticed for this client that LinkedIn steps were substantially outperforming email steps.

urn:li:activity:7211436917672816640,"5 phases of growing ColdIQ from $0 to $150k+ per month:


1ã Outbound ($0 to 7,8k MRR)

I found our first clients via simple outbound. 

My first campaign targeted companies hiring salespeople, and I was trying to sell sales automation services (as opposed to prospecting services).

My targeting was off, and the offer wasnt what the market wanted. Luckily, a few people misunderstood my pitch = and booked meetings.

I ended up closing 2 deals. The first one for $4.8k/mo& at 1 AM from my hotel room in Bali =@


Despite getting clients from this, I figured itd be easier to convert more if I built a brand.


2ã Content + Outbound ($7.8k to ~40k MRR)

We thought content would improve our cold outreach results. 
We werent generating many leads from LinkedIn, but our outbound campaigns started performing much better. 

My assumption is that people would check us out after getting outreach and see that we were regularly posting about it.

We also started leveraging content in our outboundas lead magnetswhich got us more leads than we knew what to do with&

At the same time, I noticed that the results we were getting from content were slowly compounding. 


On top of acting as a trust mechanism, it started acting as a strong demand generation engine.


3ã 2X Content ($40k to ~$90k MRR)

After consistent posting, content started generating a very continuous stream of leads. 

I figured that many people didnt make the decision to book a meeting with us because of a single post but that it was the constant exposure of publications that made them want to chat with us. 

We doubled down on content so as to always be in front of interested buyers once their circumstances change.

That said, we noticed that our most engaged audiences werent necessarily who we were selling to.


4ã New Offers ($90k to $150k MRR)

Analysing who was engaging & booking time with us, we figured that there were segments in the market that liked our approach but couldnt find a way to work with our team.

On one hand 
A. Smaller companies & individual sellers wanted to learn our methods, but we only offered (pricy) consulting. 

On the other hand
B. Larger organisations were looking into more custom setups & workflow implementations, which was out of our usual scope of work.

We introduced 2 new offers to cater to these segments of the market, and the results were immediate.


5ã More of what works ($150k+ MRR)

The plan now? 
More & better of what has worked for us.

That is;
’ Outbound: by targeting people whove been engaging with us (profile views, engagement, website visits, newsletter subscribers).

’ Outbound, with better assets (we know better what prospects are willing to pay for& that well provide for free).


’ Content
- LinkedIn: Improving the quality of our daily content and motivating more of the team to publish their hard-earned insights.

- YouTube: Alex Vacca and I will be posting 2X a week.

Since it combines 15+ data sources, it can find emails that Prospeo doesn't find.

Here's *all* you need to build a great sales stack:


1ã An extensive B2B database

Data is the starting point of every successful outbound campaign.

You can go for platforms such as LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Apollo.io, Ocean.io or Telescope to start building your lists.


2ã An accurate data enrichment tool

Once you know who to contact, your next best lever is to get accurate data from them. 

If you're looking for great platforms to find emails, you can go for:
- Prospeo: coldiq.com/tools/prospeo
- FullEnrich: ai.coldiq.com/fullenrich
- LeadMagic: coldiq.com/tools/leadmagic

If you're looking for great platforms to find phone numbers, you can use Clay (coldiq.com/tools/clay) & FullEnrich waterfall enrichment features.


3ã A Sales Engagement platform (that keeps you away from SPAM)

With Google/Outlook cracking down on cold emails... you want to make sure your sending platform has deliverability in mind.

There are several options for that:

’ Instantly (coldiq.com/tools/instantly) has pioneered multi-inbox rotation, while 
’ lemlist (coldiq.com/tools/lemlist) is the O.G of email warmup.

Both platforms now offer a done-for-you cold email setup. 
The difference is that Instantly focuses mainly on email sending, 
while lemlist also has LinkedIn outreach features

- Smartlead (coldiq.com/tools/smartlead) is another great alternative...and if you want to try your luck with LinkedIn Outreach... HeyReach (coldiq.com/tools/heyreach) is to LinkedIn automation what Instantly/Smartlead are to email automation.


4ã A reliable CRM for proper lead management

With all this generated pipeline, you'll want to make sure you don't miss out on your leads.

In this case, you can use platforms such as:
- HubSpot, Pipedrive if you're looking for solutions with many integrations
- Breakcold, folk or Attio for next-gen CRMs that are adapted to social selling.

And if you want to keep track of your conversations, an 'easy improvement' is to use note-takers such as Attention (coldiq.com/tools/attention) & tl;dv (go.coldiq.com/tldv)

Pocus looks at product usage and combines it with third-party intent signals to help you contact your target accounts at the right time.


3ã Engage with companies that are expanding (in an area related to your offering)

- PredictLeads tracks new job openings; you can look at open positions and find context to engage your target accounts with.
- Trigify.io looks at new openings, but also people who started a new role recently.

Were now expanding to YouTube (using Tella to record) and started writing bi-weekly articles for SEO (that Surfer helps optimize).

Our weekly newsletter goes out every Wednesday through beehiiv.

- [1] send them automated emails with Instantly: coldiq.com/tools/instantly
- [2] connect with them on LinkedIn via HeyReach: coldiq.com/tools/heyreach

- ai models (OpenAIs ChatGPT, Anthropics Claude) to research our prospects & personalize our emails.

- a custom deliverability infrastructure thats usually a mix of Outlook & Gmail inboxes (this can be facilitated through Instantlys new deliverability infrastructure. Seems that Lemlist is following suit there, too =@)


3ã Agency Management

We use Airtable as our Agency Operation System and a mix of n8n & Make for internal automation. 

We usually map these out on Puzzle for a high-level overview of our processes.

Most of our meetings are on Google, and the team communicates via Slack (exception being Alex Vacca calling me on WhatsApp when he feels I didnt reply fast enough =).


4ã Sales

Most deals we close are booked through our Hubspot calendar on our Webflow website.

We use Attention (coldiq.com/tools/attention) to record meetings & take notes, and send proposals with Qwilr.

Once the deal closes, we send the contract through PandaDoc and accept most payments via Stripe, which are deposited into our Mercury account.

I was reaching out to e-commerce companies.
And I wanted to personalise my cold emails.

I figured that a smart way to do this would be to go on their website and name-drop one of their products.

Id then use it in the first sentence of my outreach: 
Hey, I just checked your website, I love your [name of the product]

Because it was working so well, I was looking to scale the approach.

So, I hired a team overseas whose sole job was to visit my prospects websites and input the name of a product inside a Google Sheet. 

This was my first taste of personalization at scale


Somewhere around last year, I bumped into Clay.

As I started playing around with the tool, I realised it could also&
browse websites, and give you the name of a product& in seconds.

What required a team of 4 people to type out 1,000 of these product names (with a turnaround of a couple of days)

Was now doable with one software in 15 minutes or less.

Now, the point isnt for you to re-use this trick.

Heres why everyone at ColdIQ publishes content =G 


Imagine receiving a cold email from Adam Robinson, Guillaume Moubeche or Alex Hormozi.
Lets even say its the worst email you ever received.

Would you reply?
I know I would.

Likewise, when I get cold outreach from an AE at 
Revolut, ZoomInfo, G2 or other well-known brands...

Im more likely to take a look at their pitch.

As Alex's brand and mine became bigger&
our cold email campaigns got easier. 

Wed get better results targeting the same audience without changing the messaging that much:
’ Some would reply wanting a meeting - saying theyre already familiar with our work: Oh, I saw you on LinkedIn, guys.

’ Some would check us out and decide that we couldnt be posting that often about sales automation without knowing a thing or two.

’ But wed also get lots of inbound, which meant plenty of opportunities to learn more about the pain points and the kind of profiles we can help the most.

I ran cold outreach campaigns for 75+ organisations, and the raw truth is that some are getting disproportionally better results despite way less effort on our end.

There are many factors, such as the market, the offer, and also& the BRAND.

Every agency owner with 20+ clients knows that a big factor in their success revolves around picking the right clients.

Am I wrong, Xavier, Taylor, Alexander, Nick, Michael, Alex? 

Better clients are easier to get results for, they pay more, and they stick with you for much longer...

...and the key to finding these clients is at the intersection between how many people know about you and how many trust you to deliver results.

Content helps with both of these things.

urn:li:activity:7201286363478982658,"RB2B identifies your anonymous website visitors and pushes their LinkedIn profiles to Slack.

Heres why were implementing it for all our <ú<ø US-based clients =G 
(and why you should too)


1ã Its a low-hanging fruit to uncover intent

You get information on who visited your page and which one it was. 

Lets say your ideal client was on your pricing page and did not contact you&
&you could at least ask them why!

Likewise, we have several offers at ColdIQ: [1] Prospecting services (coldiq.com), [2] AI Sales Coaching (coldiq.com/coaching), [3] Our *FREE* databases of tools (coldiq.com/ai-sales-tools).

Depending on the page, Ill guess visitors are potentially in-market for [1] prospecting done for them, [2] learning how we run outbound, [3] new sales tools.

I use this information to route them towards different campaigns.


2ã It triggers your clients dopamine receptors

For many agencies  there will be a 2-week period where nothing happens regarding client delivery. 

Youre doing a lot: setting up email infrastructure, drafting copy, building your contact lists & more...

But clients dont see any of it and are waiting for your first outbound emails to be sent before forming their opinion of you.

Getting them information on whos on their website is a great way to provide value from day 1, and it takes ~5 minutes to set up.


3ã It helps with ICP research and messaging

Imagine thinking the only people interested in your offering are CROs in $10M+ ARR SaaS companies. 

Thus& your outbound campaigns, site messaging and all your efforts are geared towards this persona.

Upon looking at your visitors, you notice that 70% of your visitors are Marketing Directors in service-based companies. 

They all end up leaving your website because& it didnt seem there was anything for them.

This happens more often than you know. 

Actually, the most common reaction we get from clients is: wow- I didnt expect this kind of people/companies on my website =/


4ã Its evergreen.

If you cleverly set up RB2B with other platforms such as Clay, Smartlead & HeyReach  your campaigns run automatically as long as you have website visitors.

Alex Vacca did that with Apify by scraping new SDR open roles every time they were posted. This was booking us 2 meetings every week.

Its the same principle here, only even more powerful. 


5ã Your competition will be doing it

Most companies install Google Analytics to know how many visitors they have on their website.

The obvious next move? Installing a visitor identification platform to see who it is.

If you dont, youll lack insights into your audience, which your competitors have.


6ã Its free

You can push LinkedIn profiles to Slack for free. Youd only pay for the products once you want to set up integrations with other sales tech platforms.

Worst case scenario, you set it up, forget about it and never use it anymore.

Its one of these never-ending debates.

- On one hand, (almost) every company that has tested turning off open rates has seen that it positively impacts responses.

- On the other hand, its more difficult to know the bottlenecks in your campaigns if theyre underperforming.
(E.g: Are your emails in spam or not?)


For outbound agencies, theres an extra layer of complexity, 
which is that your clients might insist on keeping them on.

Our current solution:
’ we track opens initially to get a baseline of what to expect. 

That is,
How many people do we need to contact to get one positive reply?

Once we get this data, we turn them off.

And we usually see a positive lift in the 'contact-to-lead' ratio.

³ [2] export email addresses = 750 emails found
³ [3] verify emails found = 430 emails validated

’ 1200 - 430 = 770 wasted opportunities.


Here's how to get them back =G


1ã Switch to better email lookup solutions

We use Prospeo at ColdIQ to find 100,000 valid email addresses every month.
Easily one of the best tools when it comes to finding a large proportion of emails... that won't bounce.


2ã Use a waterfall solution for the unfounds

Tools like FullEnrich aggregate 15+ solutions to find email addresses (or phone numbers). If one integrated solution can't find a valid email, there's a good chance another one can. (See image)

This can mean going from 50% email addresses found up to 85%.


3ã Validate your catch-all (= unverifiable) emails

There will always be a proportion of emails found that can't be verified. 
It's best not to send to these email addresses, as it's likely to increase your bounce rate, which means more chances to be sent to spam for the rest of your outreach.

A few solutions like Scrubby & BounceBan are able to validate up to ~80% of these email addresses nonetheless.

2ã 20 Mailboxes (10 on GSuite, 10 on Outlook).

For each domain we create 2 mailboxes like so:
- michel@decoldiq.com
- alex@decoldiq.com

We make a 50:50 split between Microsoft and Google.

We do that because Smartlead auto-matches lead email providers. 
So GSuite mailboxes send to GSuite recipients, and same for Outlook to ’ Outlook.

Also, it seems Outlook mailboxes have better open rates when prospecting into larger accounts.


3ã Smartlead to power our sending and warm-up our mailboxes.

Quite simply the best platform to get your delivered in the main inbox.

1ã Create some new mailboxes and warm them up using Instantly (go.coldiq.com/instantly) or lemlist (go.coldiq.com/lemlist)

Your existing mailbox is probably blacklisted. You could try saving it& but its easier to start fresh with a new set of inboxes& and to slowly increase the volume.

Too many bounces, and its back in the spam folder again. Dan Rosenthal took the initiative of having an automation built out that pauses campaign when bounce rates go over 3%. When this happens, leads are sent to Clay, cleaned through Debounce, and added back to our campaigns.

- as few spam words as possible (Folderly & Mailmeteor help)
- plain text writing w/o HTML (doable inside of Instantly)
- as few links as possible
- spintax 


4ã Keep email warmup on at all times

Its best to use a Sales Engagement platform with built-in warmup. Within lemlist (go.coldiq.com/lemlist) & Instantly (go.coldiq.com/instantly), you can vary the number of warmup messages based on the number of emails your campaigns send.

5ã Match recipients email service providers to yours&

& which implies that its best to create mailboxes with several ESPs.

A couple of years ago, I learned one of the most profound lessons of my business life.

I was working at Visium as a Marketer and had a chat with Timon Zimmermann (Co-Founder and ex-CTO) about LinkedIn.

I recall telling him something along the lines of: 
- You should start sharing content on LinkedIn. You built an 8-figure company before the age of 30& people care about what you have to say
- You think? Well, let me think about it

A few days later, Timon told me he was in:
- Ill do it& if you do it too

So heres how my LinkedIn journey started.
But it ended. Fast.

A couple of weeks in, 
I couldnt find any inspiration and started making up some excuses.

Timon was posting every day without fault.

After a month, I hadnt started posting again,
And Timon was still posting every day.

He then got shadow-banned from LinkedIn for a little while.
But this didnt deter him, he was still posting everyday, and I was still making excuses.

He then got noticed by a local newspaper... which released a publication on him.
He was still posting daily& and I hadnt started posting again.

If that wasnt enough, his posts got him to appear on the biggest entrepreneur show on Swiss National TV. With CEOs of the countrys largest companies, such as Audemars Piguet (he even met with the CEO >/).

He was posting consistently, and& as you guessed, I still hadnt restarted to post.


We were both faced with the daily challenges of LinkedIn posting.
But he found a way to make it work - while being way more busy than I was...
And I made excuses.

When I started ColdIQ,

I promised myself that Id pick a few revenue-generating activities.
And that Id stick to these whatever happens.

I picked LinkedIn as one of these.

The difference this time?

I didnt give up :)


P.S: Timon is working on a new ""Stealth Startup"". 
I have no idea what it is... but he's one of the brightest minds I've had the chance to work with.

It tells you where it finds information&
And how confident it is about the output.

Picture this...
’ You have a list of prospects (in this case, visitors of my website, picked up by RB2B)
’ You want to classify them by ""type of business"":

- Agency
- SaaS
- E-commerce
- Other

Thus, you write a short prompt:
Claygent browses the websites&
&and starts classifying them.

Its not always straightforward to segment business models.

The fix?

Looking at Clays AI agent: 
[1] reasoning &

Heres who you should *absolutely* follow


1ã Jordan Crawford (AI Research)

His YouTube channel is a hidden gem, showcasing some great examples of first-principle thinking applied to outbound. Its not using AI for the sake of it, its uncovering problems and leveraging AI where it helps the most (e.g: account research, drafting some snippets based on said observations).

In a recent example he managed to have AI look at prospects ad images, suggest improvements and turn these into well-crafted emails through Anthropics Claude.


2ã Josh Whitfield (AI Models)

Im not sure anyone has experimented with as many AI models as Josh. Between GPT-4, Cohere, Gemini, and Claude Opus 3& Josh is an expert at using models to generate detailed research on prospects and incorporating insights from these searches into his copy. 

In a recent example, he showed how he uses OpenRouter within Clay to connect all his LLM models to Clay from just one API connection endpoint.


3ã Wayne Hamadi (AI Automation)

Wayne is consistently experimenting with various AI agents & tools to build powerful GTM automation.

In a recent publication, he showed how hes using Superagent (YC W24) to research accounts and compared it to Clays AI agent. (Spoiler: He managed to have even greater results with it than with Claygent)


4ã >ß
B Max Mitcham >ß
B Mitcham (AI SDR)

Max has been building (in public) the craziest AI automated workflows with n8n and various other APIs. 

(Hes been providing almost too much value if you ask me)

He is now building the SDR of the future with Trigify.io, and I can't wait to see where this goes.


5ã Fivos Aresti (AI Sales Tools)

Fivos knows much more about AI Sales tools than most people Ive met& and hes been putting some of the best content on LinkedIn. 

Hes publishing lists of well-curated tools and showcasing workflows in which he leverages these tech tools to generate opportunities for businesses.

It can get expensive pretty fast.
(But it doesn't need to be)

Imagine running a waterfall enrichment within the tool.
You could use up to 8 providers.
Each of them costs you 2 credits on average.

If your file has 1,000 contacts.
That means 2,000 credits if you enrich every email address.

(Sometimes, even more, if one provider finds an email, your validation tool rejects it, and a second provider looks up the email.)

2,000 credits = $149/mo
(Their plans get more interesting as you get more data, but still...)

Here's the fix:
- Clay lets you connect directly to data providers via their API
- Thus, you can get a paid plan straight at the source...

’ Using Prospeo's API, you'd pay $39 to enrich 1000 contacts.

You can replicate this logic with (almost) every data provider within Clay...

Debounce (email validation)
Builwith (technology identification)
Apollo .io (find people within company)
OpenAI (AI research & personalization)
... can all be one-click integrated via their API

Clay (ai.coldiq.com/clay) is the best tool to experiment with new data sources, workflows and enrichments.

Once you find one that you use regularly...

You can go straight to the provider.

urn:li:activity:7183868154438144002,"Are you sending cold emails through your primary domain?

Heres why you should stop =G
(And what do to instead)

Set up secondary domains.

No matter how personalized and valuable your outreach is&
A fair amount of people simply hate receiving cold pitches.

If you reach out from your main domain, it will likely be reported as spam.

This means that:
- your clients will stop receiving your invoices
- your outreach efforts will amount to nothing
- even interested, existing prospects wont get your answers

You get the gist. It can get bad. 
Many organizations are already locked out of their own email accounts.

Heres the easy fix:
’ Use Namecheap to buy new domains (5 to 10 is fine!)
’ Forward these secondary domains to your main website.
’ Create a couple of mailboxes on top of each new domain (= 10 to 20)

As an example: 
Our main domain is coldiq.com. Thus, we bought:
- decoldiq.com
- coldiqhq.com
- coldiqed.com
- (...)

These all redirect to our main domain: coldiq.com (try it =@)

And each has two mailboxes like so =G
- Michel@coldiqhq.com
- Alex@coldiqhq.com

We limit our sending to ~30 to 45 emails per inbox daily.

Thus, to send ~700 emails per day at high deliverability rates, 
we need 10 domains.

We then use Smartlead to power our sending: go.coldiq.com/smartlead

Heres why we chose HeyReach at ColdIQ


LinkedIn outreach can be extremely efficient.

Issue is, 
you cant send much more than 100 connection requests per week.

So, if you want to scale your outreach&
You need to scale the number of accounts you send from.


But most LinkedIn platforms make you pay per profile.
So youd be scaling your costs as well.


HeyReach is one of the few exceptions.

Lets run the math =G

Picture a team of 50 salespeople:
 Each reaching out through their LinkedIn account.
 LinkedIn Sending tool costs ~$99 per profile.

’ So you pay 50 * ~$99 = $4950/mo.

Using HeyReach, this would be $799/mo.

You save $4151/mo

1ã Prospeo

~90% of our outreach campaign relies on cold emails. We need to find and validate >100k emails every month, and Prospeo is a reliable way to do so.


2ã HeyReach

To power our LinkedIn outreach, we needed a solution that lets us scale the volume without scaling costs. HeyReach is the Instantly (or Smartlead!) of LinkedIn prospecting.


3ã Smartlead

With deliverability being the #1 killer of cold email campaigns - we need a platform that focuses on getting emails in the primary inbox. With features such as email warmup, provider matching, and plain text sending& 
Smartlead is in a class of its own.


4ã Clay

The secret of cold outreach campaigns that work? The right message, at the right time, to the right person. This means that account research should be a central piece of your outreach strategy. 

And no tool makes the research process as efficient as Clay. Find (almost) any information on your prospects  and leverage it in your messaging.

If you dont have much clue about&

Plenty of project ideas you wouldnt have considered doing&
And because youd never have&

Your competitors likely havent either!

This means youre now able to:

urn:li:activity:7178487512657539072,"Here's how to build your sales stack from scratch

(with the most advanced outbound tools in the market)


1ã Start by picking data source(s)

’ LinkedIn is where most B2B data sources pull their data from. You can do the same via their Sales Navigator.

’ Apollo (go.coldiq.com/apollo) is (one of) the most cost-effective source. Quality is decent, and you can easily pull large quantities of data.

’ Ocean (go.coldiq.com/ocean) has more filtering options than most data sources. For unconventional niches, it's the way to go. On top of that, they have a lookalike feature that lets you enter a company (e.g., your ideal prospect), and their algorithm finds similar organizations.


2ã Alternatively, scrape custom data

’ Sometimes, you wont find the data youre looking for on standard databases. In these cases, you can use tools such as Instant Data Scraper (completely free >/) to extract data directly from a website. 

’ Clay (go.coldiq.com/clay) also has a few built-in scrapers that let you extract data from many websites at once.


3ã Enrich contact information from your lists

You can use Prospeo to find email addresses from your LinkedIn filtering. 

For phone numbers, FullEnrich (go.coldiq.com/fullenrich) aggregates the best sources through Waterfall <
 Enrichment. 


4ã Identify buying signals and trigger events

’ RB2B identifies visitors on your website (only US traffic) and provides you with their LinkedIn profile URL and email address. Based on the page they were on, you can gauge their level of interest in (part of) your solution.

’ Humanlinker monitors top account activity inside your CRM. Youre notified whenever notable events arise (e.g., a funding event, a C-level exec changing position, an acquisition or a merger, new office opening). This is a very efficient way to re-engage your top accounts in a relevant way.


5ã Work on your sales messaging

Twains AI copilot coaches you in real-time and provides feedback to help you write better sales outreach copy.


6ã Engage your leads and stay out of SPAM

’ For LinkedIn outreach: HeyReach (go.coldiq.com/heyreach) allows you to automate 50+ accounts at an unbeatable price. Hopefully (=O), theyll soon natively integrate with Clay. 

’ For Email outreach: Smartlead (go.coldiq.com/smartlead) automates an unlimited amount of mailboxes. Plus, they have built-in warm-up features that let you improve your email reputation. (They also happen to have the best master inbox + let you build automated subsequences)


7ã Manage your pipeline

HubSpot is the gold standard of CRMs. It integrates with most other tools, so it's easy to integrate it within your existing workflows.

If youre big on social selling, you should check out what Breakcold is offering.

Also, AI note-recorders such as Attention (go.coldiq.com/attention) are life-savers for recording and taking notes during calls.

³ Search your ideal client on Sales Navigator: 1100 contacts
³ Enrich emails from the search: 650 emails found.
³ Verify these email addresses: 330 valid emails.

’ 1100 - 330 = 770 contacts& that you wont reach.

Ever happened to you?

=I Heres how to find 3 times more emails:

[1] Run emails you couldn't find in a waterfall solution (like BetterContact or Clay).

They aggregate over 10 email-finding solutions. If one software cannot find an email address, the others should be able to.


[2] Switch to a better email-finding solution like Prospeo

At ColdIQ, we're enriching ~100k emails every month through them. 
Our enrichment process starts a waterfall enrichment with Prospeo as the first solution and uses others for unfound emails.

(Pro tip: get a plan straight to Prospeo to save on Clay credits)


[3] Don't validate your catch-all (= unverifiable email addresses) if you're using a premium provider.

Email finding and verification tools use similar technology to find and validate email addresses. But premium email providers actually have a better validation mechanism than email validation tools.

The issue is that some validation tools will deem emails invalid when they are perfectly fine. When tools like Prospeo or Findymail find emails, I don't validate them, and this doesn't affect my bounce rate.

To me, it's the best way to leverage AI in sales

(I heard it from Jordan Crawford in a YouTube interview with Vaibhav)

Most sellers are hoping they'll upload a list,

And some magic AI software will personalize their outreach with a perfectly relevant message for each of their prospect.

But if it doesn't work without AI,
It won't work with it, either.

Instead,

Think about the steps you would take manually if you had unlimited time =p  to research your prospect:
’ What criteria would you look for that would make them a great fit?
’ What info would you use to personalize your message?

Once you know these, AI (& tech) can take care of most of the manual steps for you.

It took me 3 attempts and 45+ publications before getting a single lead from LinkedIn.

Now its so successful we had to stop outbound to handle our lead flow.

For my first 2 unsuccessful attempts, I gave up after around 7 to 8 publications each time.

On my third attempt, I went with a different mindset:
Id stick to posting 5X a week for 3 months straight, and only after this period, Id review if its worth it or not.

I promised to myself Id take pride in my consistency, as opposed to the results Im getting.


I published for a month and a half (around 30 publications) and nothing happened& 

Until the 31st (or 32nd) publication that went viral (for some reason) and booked 25+ meetings in my calendar. 

I often think about what would have happened if I had stopped after the first 30 posts.



Theres a thing about pushing content on Linkedin that very few people know =G 

Your buyer is watching you, 
and theyre waiting for the right time to engage. 

Many people on sales calls told me they had been seeing my content for ~2 months& and finally thought ok- I need to talk with this guy now. 

They had never engaged with anything prior.

The misconception is that you publish one *great* piece and people will book straight away in your calendar. 

But the truth is that its the constant exposure to your content that makes up their mind.

When it comes to LinkedIn content, consistency is the name of the game.

If youve been posting with no results so far&

You might want to push. 
Just a little bit more.

There are things I ask myself over and over when running new campaigns& and heres why =G 


1ã What was your ideal customer going through when they decided to reach out?

I find this a great way to uncover buying triggers. In our case, 1/3rd of the people reaching out to us are landing in SPAM. When I learn that someone has deliverability issues, I know they (a) would benefit from our help and (b) are actively prospecting. 


2ã What do my top 20% clients (by NRR) have in common? (cc Scott Martinis) 

Is a very straightforward way to find accounts for sales prospecting (but also for client retention!) - Using Ocean.io, you can build a list of similar accounts based on industry, keywords, department headcount, tech stack and buying triggers. 

Jordan Crawford phrased the same idea in a nice way: What 3-5 things must be true about a lead, that were true about your last 10 best customers, that made them an awesome fit?


3ã Whos most likely to get fired if the initiative doesnt work (cc Morgan Smith)

I find it the easiest way to think about who to target within companies. There will often be several options, thus several people to target per account. (Pro tip: Be on the lookout for unusual job titles; they sometimes say a lot about your contacts responsibilities)


4ã What could you give for FREE to your prospects that they would be willing to pay for (Alex Vacca >à=à told me that this morning; not sure he came with it =)

Its a great way to flip the script on outbound. Makes your sales messages valuable to your recipients. Your competition is asking for time in your prospects inbox. What if you gave them something they wanted without asking for anything in return?

’ Apollo (go.coldiq.com/apollo) is one of the most cost-efficient ones. Decent quality and easy to pull large quantities of data.

’ If you want to try alternative approaches to list building, you can try Oceans lookalike search (go.coldiq.com/ocean). You enter a few companies (e.g, your best clients), and their algorithm finds the most similar ones.


2ã Data scraping solutions

If you cant find suitable targeting filters from your chosen data sources... you might need to do custom scraping. You can use Instant Data Scraper (completely free >/) and Browse AI (go.coldiq.com/browse)


3ã Data Enrichment solutions

You can use Prospeo (go.coldiq.com/prospeo) to extract data straight from LinkedIn and enrich email addresses. For phone numbers, Clay (go.coldiq.com/clay) aggregates several good data sources.


4ã Buying Signals/Triggers

Humanlinker (go.coldiq.com/humanlinker) monitors the activity of your top accounts straight from your CRM. They alert you when notable events arise (e.g: fundraising, job changes, mergers/acquisitions, new office openings). Great way to re-engage accounts with relevance.


5ã Sales Copywriting

Twain (go.coldiq.com/twain) provides real-time coaching and feedback to improve your sales messages. 


6ã Deliverability

Folderly (go.coldiq.com/folderly) has the most advanced product suite to help you avoid SPAM. They offer a few free tools to generate SPF/DMARC records and check if your email copy is likely to get flagged by spam filters.


7ã Sales Engagement

’ for Emails: Smartlead (go.coldiq.com/smartlead) is the solution we use at ColdIQ. On top of email automation, you can warm up and rotate inboxes from the tool, handle all your replies in a centralized master inbox and build automated subsequences.

’ for other channels, you can use a multichannel solution such as LaGrowthMachine (https://lnkd.in/eZbDnV9y) (Twitter + Email + LinkedIn) and PhoneBurner (go.coldiq.com/phoneburner) for dialling.

Pipedrive is a great, easy-to-use solution to visually manage leads and monitor your pipeline. For more custom use cases, you cant go wrong with HubSpot. I recommend Breakcolds CRM for social engagement.

Google and Yahoo are cracking down on cold emails.

What's interesting is that some tools have been quick to react.
Got word that Woodpecker.co switched their pricing model already!

You're no longer paying for each email account you connect. You're paying for the total volume sent.

This is big... considering that a well-known workaround for blacklisted domains is to create secondary domains and mailboxes.

Problem is, that with most platforms, it ends up costing you a lot.
Quick math:
³$59/seat per month * 20 accounts = $1180/month
³ $94 per month for unlimited accounts = $94/month

You're saving $1000+ by switching to providers such as Smartlead, Instantly.ai, QuickMail, Saleshandy and now... Woodpecker.co too.

Think about it&

When a company pays for a tool& they must be making money from it.

’ Would you pay for verified email addresses if you couldnt get a positive ROI?

Successful revenue tools are helping their clients make& more revenue:
- Email finding software helps companies find people they can reach out to& ultimately (hopefully) resulting in new clients.

- Email warmup software helps companies improve their deliverability& resulting in more messages being seen, more interested prospects and ultimately new clients.

- Intent signals software helps companies reach out to people currently facing an issue they help with& resulting in messages being more relevant to the recipient, translating to more replies, meetings& and ultimately new clients.

This logic holds across 50+ categories of sales software.

And if you dont understand how you can leverage these sales tools& theyll show you themselves: they have every incentive to help you be successful with them.

So, how can you use this to your advantage?

Heres why I do =G

Building a content motion has had the most significant positive impact on my prospecting efforts&

Imagine reaching out to someone cold.

Whats the first thing theyll likely do?
My guess?

Wondering who the f*** is this Michel Lieben Lieben guy sitting in their inbox.
(Hes a cool guy, trust me =)

Say they bump on my LinkedIn.
And theres not much information.
Difficult to trust me, right?

However, if they look me up, theyll see I posted quite a few times about this prospecting thing Im pitching them on.

Way easier to trust me now!

For this reason, content is a no-brainer for me.

But what happens next is even better&
Content attracts eyes, which eventually turns into prospects and meetings.

And these people who come to you& are from very different backgrounds and industries and have very different use cases.

Needless to say, you wouldnt have reached them since they were very different from your ideal customer profile (ICP).

Heres the problem with ICPs, though.

Theres only so much you can learn through research.

Say you sell something generic like outbound sales outsourcing.
Who could value your services? Lots of companies.

So you could guess that B2B SaaS Companies with high ACV in x industry are a good fit for you.

But you dont know for sure.

With content, people come to you.

This allows you to battle-test your methodology in different industries for different personas.

And from time to time, youll have a breakthrough. 
That, for example, sales prospecting campaigns work even better in some under-explored industries.

And now you have a secret& you know something that your competition doesnt.

Outbound works great for x specific niche, and IS even easier to make work.

So now you can single out companies in these industries.
And go after them.

With better results.

If you see that happening on your LinkedIn feed& avoid taking any of their advice.

I know its tempting.

The post has lots of social proof.
And theyre all agreeing.

They think that because a message doesnt work on them, it wont work on anyone.
(Also there is lots of bad outreach too, ngl)

But as the saying goes: you dont ask a fish how to catch a fish. 
You ask a fisherman.

Some people do that for a living&
Theyre the ones you should be listening to.

Here are some of my recommendations:

For us, that means:

1) Creating valuable content every day (or trying to!)

2) Building useful assets for our ideal customer

3) Reaching out to them every day


Then it's a constant game of iterations, patience and trust in the process.

You do it long enough, and it all clicks together...

- Useful assets build trust with complete strangers
- Useful content builds trust with complete strangers

- Reaching out to them put you on their map
- Putting out content keeps you in their mind

When you do something every day, you become better at it...

So the assets you build become more valuable
The content you put out attracts more eyes
Your ideal target becomes... 'more ideal'

After trying various providers and looking at >¾Erics email finders comparisons - I can tell you theres a high probability that Prospeo finds more emails than your current solution.

[3] Run all your catch-all (= unverifiable email addresses) in enrow: go.coldiq.com/enrow

But not much clue about&
³ who they should target
³ how to package their offer
³ how much to charge their clients

Theyre speaking to me because they want to do cold outreach to generate opportunities.

My #1 advice is NOT to rely on cold outreach when you start.

Prospecting is hard&
Its a full-time job for many.

If you dont have a clear idea of
- who is your ideal customer
- the most significant pain point you solve&

Its an almost impossible task.

Instead, I advise posting about your expertise on a social platform (like LinkedIn).

Youll have to be patient to start getting some inbound opportunities&
But people come to you with different problems and thoughts on how you can help them.

Thus, you find plenty of ways to leverage your skills youd never thought of&
And because youd never have thought of these ways&
Your competitors likely havent!

This means youll be able to:
’ find creative ways to use your skills
’ find untapped niches/markets
’ identify patterns in problems people/companies are encountering

Finding out about these will help you come up with a GREAT offer&

And now you know:
’ who to target
’ what to sell them
’ how to package your services

=I Thats when using outbound becomes a great way to generate opportunities.

Outbound pros, inbound pros and the peeps in between& do you feel differently about this?

This is the *trick* to find more contacts from your existing efforts&

=I Waterfall Enrichment

Simply put you:
1ã Run your lead lists in a first data source, then&
2ã Run unfound email addresses through a second one&
3ã And run all unfound from the two sources through a third one&

You do that until you run out of data sources&
Or until you find all the contact information you need!

Now& data enrichment isnt cheap.

And you want to avoid paying for 5-6 active subscriptions simultaneously.

The solution?

Tools such as BetterContact & Clay aggregate multiple data sources within their platform.

This means you can run waterfall enrichment
’ affordably
’ for the price of a single subscription
’ with no complicated technical set-up

1ã Smartleads Vaibhav Lead Gen System: guide.smartlead.ai

One of the most comprehensive resources on cold email. It covers technical setup, deliverability, copywriting, follow-up, data sources and more... 

As one of the fastest-growing software in the sales tech space, you can bet Smartlead's team is getting lots of insider insights into what works and what doesn't.


2ã Clays ""AI for Sales Prospecting"" guide: clay.com/aiguide
 (by >¾Eric Nowoslawski & Vidushi (Mishti) Sharma)

If you've seen some of Eric's videos, you know he is far ahead of most sales professionals when it comes to using AI. Plus, this is actually the only guide I found that covers leveraging AI within sales prospecting in such depth.


3ã Amplemarket Academy: amplemarket.com/academy

Not a guide per se, but a collection of sales guides across every prospecting subtopic there is. Amplemarket is powering some of the best outbound teams, and it shows when you see the quality of their content.


4ã Valentin's Findymail's Playbook: playbook.findymail.com

Valentin has built one of the most accurate email finding software on the market, and has been leveraging its data to cold email his way to $1M ARR (pretty sure he learned a thing or two in the process!)
